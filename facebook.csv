0,l66c5u,Account Disabled by Facebook - what might be the reason behind the disablement of my account? Any help will be highly appreciated.,"Hello to everyone around.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm facing this problem and i thought Reddit might be a place where i can find some answers or possible ways to recover my account that Facebook just disabled for no reason at all. I recently created a new Facebook Id and then created a Page for my online business. But Facebook was okay until the creation of it all and then suddenly, i got a message that my account is disabled because it was in conflict with the Community Standards. I was shocked because i never even posted anything to both to my Facebook profile and the page. To secure my account i activated 2 step authentication and tweaked the over all account security a little bit. Facebook never even bothered to tell me what actually was the reason that compelled them to disable my account. The point is i had that unique username that i can not have because Facebook decided to disable my account.

Any ideas how can i recover my account?

&amp;#x200B;

i have tried sending a message to [Disabled@facebook.com](mailto:Disabled@facebook.com) but they haven't replied yet or maybe they aren't going to reply at all. Any gurus out there? I'll be thankful if anyone can share any solution to this mess.

Regards.",facebook,submission

It seems the final step is to enter a login code that I can get from a code generator. When I google it, it seems the only way to get to the code generator is to log in first.

No matter what I do, Facebook will not properly accept my bank account information. I have double and triple checked my routing and account number to be absolutely 100% I entered it correctly.

I tried multiple browsers and 2 different devices, however it still will not work. On my laptop, when I click on the button to link my bank account, nothing happens. The page goes unresponsive and the window does not open. When I click that same button on my phone, however, it does guide me to the correct screen to enter my account number, routing number, legal name and address. I enter it 100% accurately, however Facebook guides me back to my ""your listings"" page and presents me with the same link to 'link my bank account'. This causes a continuous loop of entering my bank info, and then being led back to the same button that is telling me to link my account. I have been trying to resolve this for days, and I have customers who will not receive there products on time because of this Facebook error.

12,l6cayk,"Unable to login to Facebook, being sent around checkpoint loop repeatedly, no response at all from Facebook ""support"".","In December I decided to have a security / privacy checkup on FB, and removed old app and device permissions. I thought a password update could be good too, and every day since then I have been stuck in this highly unentertaining loop:

* I log in with my most recently created password
* I go to the checkpoint page and get told I need to secure my account:

https://preview.redd.it/h3klw7qtdxd61.png?width=658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab080f08316605349ec134733662b40d802675ec

I click ""Get Started"", go to to the next screen:

https://preview.redd.it/fr3dlyntdxd61.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb1f84684ac2e7d8db643cc0094a526c2d943bdc

Then onto the next screen:

https://preview.redd.it/9f9x0zptdxd61.png?width=696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=569854270f0b2d79cae1475a701d13eacfc4e818

Then I get an error screen:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/21gi9k46exd61.png?width=650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75c5d0f71e25cb8da987739ec4456ff92827f592

* If I click Continue here, or try to enter another password, I get told I have been logged out.
* I then have to go back to the login screen and start the whole process over again, same result every time.

The password I change to is being stored somewhere as, if I enter my last password before the most recent change, it tells me that I updated my password X minutes / hours ago and to login with that.

Password resets seem to work up to exactly the same point, so I get a code to enter but then get taken straight to the secure your account screen. This is the same on different PCs on different networks, with adblockers turned on or off, private browsing on or off, VPN on or off.

I have attempted to contact FB about 10 times using their contact form that they don't read, and am at a loss. I have a business page that is receiving enquiries and hits that I cannot respond to but, because I don't spend $1,000s on advertising nobody is interested in helping me out.

I know similar issues have been posted here, I'm just wondering if anyone else has had THIS issue, and how it got resolved?",facebook,submission

They blocked my only friend on there and then she added his parents and siblings on my account. I have some sensitive pictures that were in the chat and now I’m worrying if they were going to share that. She changed my profile pic to her’s (I’m assuming that, it could be someone else’s) and she added a bunch of people I don’t know, and it seems like they know her. What do you guys think? I really need advice cause I don’t people to see those pictures and idk how they even for access to my account. It was hacked the night I was asleep and everything was in French.I already changed my password but I don’t know if there’s anything else I can do or why she was doing all this.",facebook,submission

I'm a Business page owner in Europe on Facebook and many clients are talking to us every day via Messenger on Facebook.

Your Account Has Been Disabled
You can’t use Facebook because your account, or activity on it, doesn’t follow our Community Standards.
If you think we disabled your account by mistake, we can take you through a few steps to request a review.

Then it says that due to COVID-19 there are fewer people to review all requests. I submitted a review &amp; it wanted me to submit my driver’s license, so I did. Then I got another message saying the same thing about it talk longer to review my information.

But what concerns me is that my license has a different last name than what was on Facebook, because Facebook had my stage name. Will this affect the outcome?

I had 3 strikes last year, which had never happened ever in the 8 years I used Facebook. Once in June or July (which was 3 days) another in August (i think that was a week) &amp; last in November (which was 30 days). Do those 3 violations from 2020 carry over to 2021?

I need a suggestion for how to recover a page. I have my personal account and I created a page with (example) URL \_facebook.com/mypagename. After some time I created a secondary account only dedicated to this page (as a company page) but, due to my inexperience I stupidly deleted the page thinking I could recreate it in the other new account the same page with the same direct URL \_facebook.com/mypagename. Unfortunately I discover that once ""reserved"" a URL name (in this case ""mypagename"") is not possible to use it anymore and the alternative I can have are something horrible like ""mypagename\_123123"". I tried to google around and found some form in facebook support to submit request for help but never received reply. It's been several months now and I still haven't been able to find a way to get the URL back because nobody of support reply me.

I literally have spent so much time researching and trying to figure this out and troubleshoot it to no avail. And obviously Facebook support is NO help.

The problem: I am unable to comment on other peoples facebook pages directly. Which includes birthday messages, and seeing any others birthday messages as well. I noticed it when I tried to wish someone a happy birthday. I thought they had blocked me, but in reality it wouldn't let me see others happy birthday messages on her wall, and it also wouldn't let me post directly. Now I've made the connection it won't let me do this for anyone's wall. The only way I can wish people Happy Birthday is through the notification drop down, and when I manually search others pages it doesn't show me other peoples birthday messages to them (even if my wife can see them on her account), or other peoples posts on their wall.

I'm really at a loss, because NO these people haven't blocked me, it has nothing to do with me, I've never been offensive to anyone or reported for anything. All I do is wish people happy birthday from time to time and this problem has only been going on for about 6 months now.

The way I decided who got the boot I asked myself ""Do I have a close enough relationship with this person to want them to have a view into my personal life and photos?"" If the answer was no, I hit the unfriend button.

I felt so much better afterward. It was shocking the amount of acquaintances i.e. people I graduated with, coworkers, someone I met at a party and had a good conversation with years ago etc. that was having a view into what was going on in my life. I think it's a maturity thing too, cause once upon a time I cared about having hundreds of ""friends"" on Facebook. So dumb.

I still get friend requests from acquaintances and coworkers who I've maybe spoken to a handful of times in real life. Also have gotten a few resends of requests from people I unfriended during the purge. I leave them unanswered so they won't keep resending. It's just weird how they think I'm going to want them seeing my posts and photos when in they know next to nothing about me. And in the past, if I accepted them,  they don't talk to me, usually don't even react to posts, just lurk. It's just weird man! 

For example, there is this random guy who is a friend of a friend who's from the UK and I've never met and don't have anything in common with. He's sent me multiple requests (hence why I've stopped declining) and even messages me  on holidays and stuff. I mean, it's nice, but if I don't know you I'm not adding you. Don't care how many mutual friends we have.

So basically if he logs out, he can’t log back in again because he doesn’t remember his password, and he can’t change his password because his account is connected to his phone #, which currently has SMS and calls turned off due to his mother canceling his plan, and he can’t change his login info to email because again, he doesn’t know his password.

 Last night I found out my account was hacked. I attempted to reset the password and regain control of my account but I found out that whoever hacked it changed the main e-mail address on the account. So, whenever I try to reset the password, contact support etc., I am redirected to a password reminder prompt that will only send a confirmation to that one email address, which isn't mine.

 So, I basically cannot do anything to get my account back. Googling the matter is unhelpful and there is nothing in the facebook help wizard that is applicable or comes close to addressing my problem. This is very frustrating and I need access to messenger.

What I did was register my trademark then after long month of waiting for my file to be ok , I used my trademark to take the ancient page down. But facebook didn't wanted too because the page was created earlier than the trademark

I added my new PayPal account (about two months old) to an old Facebook account a few days ago.

Today I noticed they removed tens of small transactions starting from early this morning. They started with a few $5 transactions.. to $10 and then did about 12 $30 transactions before I noticed. I only noticed because PayPal sent me a random notification that they refunded one of the $10 transactions.

I checked my Facebook account (the one with the PayPal tied to it) and none of these transactions show on my Payment history. Does this mean someone was able to add it to a desperate account? 

I’ve disputed this with PayPal and once I get my money back to my debit card I’m going to immediately delete my PayPal account. I’ve also changed my passwords everywhere and will probably go ahead and get a new debit card. I also unlinked Facebook from my PayPal and unlinked PayPal from my Facebook.

Trying to find resources on any of this but I can't, so I'm not sure what to do. Was hoping reddit may have some insight.  


My thoughts on my options are: 

* complete the verification and leave the personal account running, hope for the best
* delete the personal account, complete verification, hope for the best
* delete the marketing account before verification - unsure about whether or not this might put a black mark on my Business Manager, I have colleagues manage it.

I didn't realize they didnt accept it until I resubmitted the same ID, so now I wait for another chance so I can submit my passport photo.

In the meantime, we cannot access our bar's Facebook account (yes, i know i should have more than one admin, but I forgot to resolve that before this happened). 

And yes, i did go the way of getting a hacker, which was stupid, but i was desperate, and after $100, he couldn't complete the job w/o $150 more, and I'm not sending it.

790,l0tibl,Locked out for 24 hours for trying to reset my password too many times 😭 Does the 24 hour time limit reset with each attempt?,"
So long story short, I couldn’t remember my Facebook password at all. So I decided to try and reset it (using the 3 special contacts that you set up to give you a code if you ever get locked out). Apparently I attempted this too many times and now I’m locked out of my Facebook for 24 hours. 

I got locked out about 10:30am yesterday and attempted to reset it again today about 10:00am (I got anxious and wanted to see if it would work). It said I was still locked out. So I waited an additional hour which would have put me well past the 24 hour mark and I’m still getting the same message that I am locked out for 24 hours due to attempting to reset my password too many times. 

My question is, does anyone know if the 24 hour lock “resets” with each attempt? Am I now going to have to wait until about 11:00am tomorrow to try again? 

***I no longer have access to the email attached to my Facebook account. It is inactive. And for whatever reason Facebook won’t text me a code or let me use my phone number in any way.

796,l0vzgh,"Why, when I send a bunch of images at once to someone in Messenger, Facebook always randomizes the order of the images?","Sometimes I want to send multiple images at once to a friend, but I want them to stay in a particular order. For example, comics, mangas, or any other type of image collection that only makes sense when presented in a particular, fixed sequence. Unfortunately, Facebook will always automatically change the order in which each image appear if I send them all in a single message. So in case of a comic for example, the fourth page can appear as the first page, the first page can be the last, and so on.

The only way to avoid this is to send each image one by one, in the order I want them to appear. This sucks because it is time consuming and boring, especially when I want to send a ton of images.

Why there isn't an option to ask if I want to send them in the order I preseented, or if I am okay with the images being randomized? That doesn't happen when I am making a post on my profile on a group, only with messages. Also, that doesn' happen in Whatsapp, only in Facebook Messenger.",facebook,submission

878,kzta2j,How I got back my hacked account : success story (after many days of trying almost everything possible!),"Hey!

I woke up a few days ago and I saw in my emails that someone changed the password of my Facebook account (and the hacker turned on the two factor authentication). Here's a little part of my previous post to put you in context:  
""I tried many things, like ""I forgot my password"" and went to the Facebook help pages. At first the hacker removed my e-mail from the account so it didn't work with ""I forgot my password"" so long story short I used the function that I had to send Facebook a picture of my ID so they can send my a link to reset my password. So I received the link pretty quickly yesterday morning, but when I click on it, it says ""*You* have *tried entering too many codes*. *Try* again later"".I tried a few times yesterday and today and it still says that. What should I do next? I really want my account back :/ at first I thought I would wait until the ""*You* have *tried entering too many codes""* would not show up but I don't know when it will happen.""

Since that post, I've been able to change my password after waiting a few days until it didn't say that I tried too many codes. I still wasn't able to access to my account because of the two factor authentication, but I was able to find the solution here on [r/facebook](https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/). You have to go on your computer (not your phone) and try to log in your Facebook account. And when it says that it sent a code to the authentication app, you have to click on something at the bottom of the page, I don't remember the exact words but it is something like ""You didn't receive your code?"" or something similar. From there, you can explain your problem to Facebook. You also have to join a picture of your ID. For me it was really quick, it took less than 12 hours to get an answer.

So right now I have a new password and I enabled the two factor authentication for myself, so it will be more secure for the future.

Don't hesitate to ask me any questions if you need help, because I'm really grateful since that subreddit has helped me to have my facebook account back.",facebook,submission

923,l04b8q,"Account hacked, password phone and email all changed and nothing I can do","I woke up this morning to a bunch of emails and notifications on my phone sent around 3am saying that someone was trying to access my account, as well as security codes sent to my email as a result of trying to change the password. I tried logging in but the hacker changed my phone number, email address and password so there is nothing I can do. I was under the impression that 2-factor authentication was supposed to prevent this from even happening, but here I am.

I went to Facebook support on my PC to see if there is anything I can try... all pages point me to the same page about recovering a hacked account and ask me to visit a page and report my account as compromised. This sends me down a repeating loop that asks me to:

* enter my current or old pw (current pw has obviously been changed)
* next page tells me that my pw was changed ""X hours ago"" and ""If you don't know the current password on your account, you need to reset your password to continue. ""
* Selecting ""secure my account"" sends me to a page asking me ""how I want to reset my password"", but the only option is to send a code to the listed email address, which is not mine.
* The only other thing I can do is say ""I no longer have access to this""  which gives me 2 options... I can enter my old password and the entire process repeats itself, or I say again that ""I cannot access my email"" to which the response is *""Unfortunately, we're not able to give you access to the Facebook account you're trying to log into. This is because we can't confirm that it belongs to you. We may hide the information on your Facebook account if we detect that you cannot regain access to it.""*

I can't find anything anywhere to actually communicate with a human, and the automated ""guided help"" tool just keeps sending me to the place that [asks to send a code the the email address that the hacker has changed](https://i.imgur.com/vcGMVef.jpg). I don't see anything anywhere that is remotely helpful, is there anything at all I can do or is my account lost for good? No issues for 13+ years then BAM! Account gone :(",facebook,submission

It wants me to get a code from the code generator, but how am I supposed to do that without access to Facebook. I've tried having it send a code to my phone, but it never comes. I've also tried to just reset my password again but the person who got in apparently changed the contact email.

966,kz969h,Is there Anyway to get actual help for a account ban (brand new account),"As the title Says.  


I had an account for years, and eventually had it removed. I had some stalker like activity and relatives of someone show up at my house YEARS after bad business dealings (where in their relative ""bought"" a car, and never finished paying it off) I had to close my account, because I was getting calls, emails, and even having them showing up at my house and driving by constantly for months and I had to just go entirely dark on every social media platform.

&amp;#x200B;

I remade my account last year, or tried to. I created it with the same email I had before.  I however shortened my last name by 3 letters, So If the people from above tried again I would not show up. I added maybe three friends or whatever Was required to get access at the time to FB market place. I am aware that this is a violation of the requirement that you use ""the legal name you go by"" yaddda yaddaaa, but it seems like you could make a special case for this? Or at least get a Review. Add to that, I can find people with all sorts of crazy names that you know are not real, people that use pen names, performance names (lots of drag queens as an example) and so forth that are not getting perma-banned.

I messaged one person about a car they had for sale ( the Same One I own, I needed it for parts). I sent them pictures of my car(s) showing I was a serious buyer. We were actively chatting and setting up a time for me to drive MULTIPLE states away to come look at and get the car, and I was locked out and banned. I lucked out because the person that purchased this car resold it a few weeks later after the ""new turbo"" in it blew up... But I'd Still like my account back.  


I had appealed the ban with a photo ID. I never heard back, I was never Notified why I was banned. Its been a year or so with no resolution.

I've searched trying to find a real person : found numbers but they ring forever or just hang up after the 6th ring. Ive tried finding the old ""live chat"" business support but I cannot seem to find that either.

I tried to make a new account with the same email, phone number, and name as it appears on my ID AND as it appeared when created last year on facebook. But my email is banned apparently.

I hardly posted content other than a picture of half my face or so looking back at the car, my fiance. I did not repost garbage, make political, racial, ethnic, religious commentary, I did not post inappropriate photos, or anything that could be in violation of any community content. I literally used it only to message people about items I wanted to buy.

**I tried the email and photo ID and note resolution path.**

**I tried** [**https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/571927962827151**](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/571927962827151) **, but clicking send never seems to actually do anything, like its a dead link designed to waste ones time.**

**I tried the numbers people post on face books own help pages ( which I do suspect are fake).**

&amp;#x200B;

The reason for this now? A commercial light truck from another country is for sale in my area and only the second Ive seen in the USA in about 15 years, and I really want to reach out to the person. They talked to me in a automotive paint store a few years ago, but we never exchanged information. All I got to go on is his first name, but the truck is listed now on Marketplace and id love to call.",facebook,submission

Can somebody please help?,"So about 2 days ago I had received some emails that my Facebook account had been logged into, and that someone managed to change the password. I didn’t see these until today when I tried to login to Facebook and it wouldn’t let me. 

I went through some sort of process to regain control of my account, and noticed they also switched the email and phone number, which allowed me to replace that email with a different email of mine. I was also able to change the password. I saved the email that they had used in case in might be useful.

Now when I try to login, it tries to put me through the 2 step verification process which would send a code through sms I believe. I’m not able to find which number they now have on there, therefore I’m not able to receive this code to login. 

I had also received an email mentioning that my Facebook account had been suspended from certain features, I’m hoping this is facebook catching some sort of malicious activity. My girlfriend tried to click on my account from her device and nothing happens when she clicks to view my profile. Also when she views the messages I sent her through the messenger app, it shows all my sent messages from the past like year as not available.

I’ve been logged out of my account on all devices and from I’ve researched Facebook doesn’t have a direct contact email or number so I figured maybe I would try my luck here. 

If anyone knows any additional steps I can take to recover my account, or at least permanently delete it or something so I can start anew, I would greatly appreciate any and all help.

Everything was fine until I got the final phone which I want to use, there I got the problem that I can't send myself an SMS because of a limit of protection.

Hi all! Long story short, I deleted my Facebook account in early December for personal reasons (I was super bummed out with friends and politics). Recently, my superiors at work indicated they would like me to manage a Facebook page, but I can't sign up for a new account. Facebook keeps telling to input my real name (I am, and it's fairly common).

I've even supplied different e-mail address and phone numbers than I've previously used (I have 3 different e-mail addresses, and two cell phones)--hoping that was the problem--still no luck after I've cycled through different permutations.

The help page directs me to this link to upload my ID: [https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/237843336274237](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/237843336274237)

I upload my valid ID as instructed, but when I attempt to submit it I receive the following error message: ""There was a problem with this request. We're working on getting it fixed as soon as we can."" I've used multiple browsers, devices, and internet connections to try this--still no success.

Is there anything I could do at this point? Nothing seems to work and there's no real customer support to speak of. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks in advance!",facebook,submission

That stopped synching last week -- errors saying, ""Can't connect right now.""

1236,kwzqxl,Is there any direct way to report the scam ads that are seemingly running rampant on Facebook?,"I'm going to preface by saying that while I now realize this looks like I am ranting, I am truly asking for help because I am beyond frustrated at this point.

Let me explain. Beginning in November, I started seeing more and more fake/scam ads (cars,boats,rvs,atvs,etc) on the platform. I would use the automated reporting system, but it soon became apparent that it was a waste of my time, as I would always get a reply back ([https://i.imgur.com/t35Px5O.png](https://i.imgur.com/t35Px5O.png)) that said the post ""Doesn't go against any one of our community standards"". Community standard #5 ([https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/violence\_criminal\_behavior](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/violence_criminal_behavior)) states ""Fraud and Deception: In an effort to prevent fraudulent activity that can harm people or businesses, we remove content that purposefully deceives, willfully misrepresents or otherwise defrauds or exploits others for money or property. This includes content that seeks to coordinate or promote these activities using our services. We allow people to raise awareness and educate others as well as condemn these activities.""

That's it. I can send it back for a review, but the reply back is basically the Same.Exact.Thing

It's to the point where if it's a hacked account, and I'm able to find a contact phone # via Google, I will text the actual account holder (because I can't send via Facebook messaging because the hacker will intercept) a screen shot of the ad, a link to the ad (because the hacker will hide the ad from the actual account holder's page and turn off notifications), ask them to change their password then delete the ad before anybody gets ripped off, and lastly to check their CC statements as these hackers almost always use the CC on file of the accounts they hack, sometimes up to 100's of $$. That usually works, but sometimes it doesn't. Case in point tonight. The imgur image I linked above is from this very ad that I reported earlier tonight. The ad is for a 2013 Ford Raptor SVT for $21k. The hacker has blocked my ability to reply to the ad stating that it's a scam to warn others, and I contacted the actual account holder with a phone # I found online, but there has been no response. My last resort was to report it to Facebook knowing that nothing would come of it, but it was my last resort. People are replying to this ad inquiring about more info, location, etc. and I feel helpless that I am unable to do anything to warn people from getting scammed. Btw, KBB values this pickup at nearly $50k retail. This is commonly what these hackers do. You send them an email, they will give you some sob story of why it's so cheap and they just want to get rid of it, and to pay with eBay gift cards. Then &lt;&lt;poof&gt;&gt; they disappear.

There are also the fake pages that are just created within the last day or two, some of them that say that are selling cosmetics for example, but then advertise a car in a fake/scam ad. But that's a whole other story on why these fake pages are allowed to be created so easily and then immediately are able to post scam ads.

One of the options given is for me to block these ads when I see them. But then I feel I would be equally complicit as Facebook is. Besides that, a whole new round of hacked/fake pages would start fresh the very next day and it would just be an endless cycle of me blocking random people, all the while knowing people are getting scammed out of thousands of $$. 

For being a big-tech company, Facebook sure fails in common sense. 

I would like to add that while many companies fail miserably to remove these ads/fake pages when reported, there is one company that is extremely pro-active when I report these ads. Weebly. I can send them a link to a fake page, and it's almost always taken down within minutes. 

So my question is this. Is there any way to talk to an actual human, whether it be thru email or online chat, so I can explain what it is they are looking at when I report these? Because the automated reporting system is absolute trash, and IMO, Facebook is being completely complicit with these ads by not removing them when they are being straight-up told they are scams beforehand.",facebook,submission

1311,kxgaz4,My new Facebook account has been disabled because I have some inactive accounts. Is there anything I can do?,"Hi,

A few days ago I've created an account and wasn't able to log in without confirming my phone number on the next day. After I've confirmed my phone number, they immediately let me back into my account. One or two days after that they've asked me for a selfie and I've uploaded it for review. Sadly this time the account got disabled a few days later.

&gt;**Your Account Has Been Disabled**  
You can't use Facebook because your account, or activity on it, didn't follow our Community Standards.  
We have already reviewed this decision and it can't be reversed.

All I did so far was adjusting settings and creating two pages, so it must be because of my other accounts that I've created at a young age and I don't have access to anymore. I never behaved bad on the platform, in fact, all I did back then was playing The Sims Social. Since I'm an EU citizen, I've contacted their DPO today and attached my passport, with the request to delete any accounts that led to the deactivation.

Anything else I could do? Is there a chance that I'll get my account back, eventhough the message states it can't be reversed?

Thanks in advance!",facebook,submission

1313,kxgz5b,Facebook account got disabled upon creation. I tried going through the appeal process but that's pointless because there's nothing to reference phone number/picture of me to. Hope the titles is long enough to not get deleted again ...,"(Pls have mercy automod)

So  I used to have a facebook account up until 2/3 years ago when I got it  deleted because I wasn't using it anymore. Now I wanted to get in touch  with friends from high school, tried to create an account with a legit  email and my actual name obviously. I hit sign up and am greeted with a  message that my account got disabled. I tried to do the appeal process,  gave them a phone number and a photo etc. which was weird because they  obv got nothing for reference. No luck obv, another message saying the  decision is final and I violated they terms of service. I tried another  browser and an older email adress aswell as my google adress, same  result.

I can imagine that because  I had an account once it somehow interferes with that, but even when I  choose another name (like a short version of my first name) I get just  an ""error creating account"". But then again, it was supposed to be  DELETED soo ...

This wouldn't be  an issue if there was a way to contact support but for some reason the  like 2nd biggest company in the world doesn't have that? Only a help  website with random question that don't apply to me.

Anyone have similar experiences? I'm about to lose my mind, guess they don't need my juicy data.

I wake up to find out I cannot login to facebook and my email/phone number was changed. How did this hacker get the security code on whats app?

I have some thoughts to this as I do use whats app on my desktop too. Could they have remote desktop in to view my whats app? Could there be a breach in whats app?

Does anyone know on facebook if you need to change your phone number/email it would prompt to verify a code on your phone and email respectively? Would I not have been notified via email or txt that my recovery items have been changed? I didn't receive any.

I'm now over the age of 18 and was wondering whether changing the age on my Facebook account could get me banned. The age set on my Facebook would be around 27 years oldat the moment. I am concerned about the ban because I have my Oculus account linked to Facebook along with having many memories in there. If no ban will be given, what else could happen when changing my age?

Hey there!

So I am having all sorts of problems with the facebook page of my father. He has a page of around 21 thousand followers.

If he tries to log in into the account he gets [this error](https://marcotran.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Marco-Tran-The-Simple-Entrepreneur-Fix-Facebook-Page-too-many-redirects-issue.jpg). I circumvented the problem by typing in [facebook.com/home](https://facebook.com/home) in the adressbar after a supposed guide to fix this problem told me to do so. The guide further said to switch to the classic design and to log out and back in to fix the issue for good. Now i did just that but the issue still prevails and many posts were deleted after the switch to classic mode. How can i switch back to the new mode, i see no such option.

And there is another option. When he logs in into the account an account shows up which only has 165 followers. When you click on the home page icon and on short cuts only there is the ""real"" account with 21k followers. How can he access this site directly?

Based on the posts I've seen on this thread and others, this seems to be a reasonably common problem. TAKE STEPS NOW TO SECURE YOUR ACCOUNT! It may be a pain in the neck, but it's far easier to proactively secure your account than it is to deal with the stuff I went through.

My account (or, more accurately, one owned by a family member but I'll refer to it as mine for brevity) was hacked on approximately December 13th. Though the source of the hacking was unclear, my guess is that it was because 2FA was not enabled and the e-mail/password used for the account had been involved a different password breach.

The hacker immediately changed the recovery e-mail on the account so I was not able to do a password reset. Eventually, I used [facebook.com/hacked](https://facebook.com/hacked) and was able to reset the e-mail and password by verifying comments that I had made on various posts recently.

Unfortunately, the hacker had also enabled 2FA on the account, so even after successfully resetting the e-mail and password associated with the account, I was still unable to log in. I had no other browsers logged in to issue an approval, I did not have a mobile number attached to the account, I had not set up trusted friends ... nothing.

Since I (really, the family member) do not having a driver's license, passport, or similar government issued ID, I attempted to submit alternative forms of ID (mail, medical documentation, etc.) to the ""having trouble"" that's available when you're unable to log in via 2FA. I did this primarily in the mobile app. Whenever I'd submit, it would simply take me to the Facebook Help page, and I really had no idea whether the submission was working.

After doing this a few times, I eventually received a message that there were too many submissions and that my account would be prevent from making more submissions for an unspecified period of time.

I even reached out to some friends I know that work at Facebook, but Facebook internal policies didn't allow my friends to help a family member that they did not know personally. If it had been my account they could have helped, but since the account belongs to a family member, there was nothing they could do.

Finally, I got a copy of my birth certificate, waited for the lockout to expire (I tried once every 48 hours until it didn't give me the message), and submitted the request via a PC Web browser (not mobile).

Within about 5 days after that final submission, Facebook replied with a link that I was able to use to log in without 2FA, then set up 2FA with my phone number, the 2FA app, and grab some recovery codes.

All told, I was without access to the account for about 30 days.

So here are some final tips:

* If you get that e-mail saying the recovery e-mail has been changed, ACT ON IT QUICKLY before the hacker can do any damage.
* If this happens to you, DO NOT CREATE A NEW ACCOUNT. Not only is this against Facebook's terms of service, but it'll confuse any support requests you put in. Your new account may be locked if you create it with the same name or e-mail address, and then you've now got two problems instead of one.
* Enable 2FA on your account.  Use an authenticator app if you can. Get recovery codes.
* Have a good government issued ID. If you don't drive, get a state ID. Keep your passport renewed. Don't have to call your parents to find your birth certificate.
* If you find yourself hacked and unable to receive a 2FA code but you were able to reset your password, use the help links when you're prompted for a 2FA code. Submit on PC and mobile, but don't spam it. You'll get rate-limited.
* When you submit, if the app or browser redirects you to the Facebook help page, that's a successful submission.
* There's no way to talk to a person or get a ticket opened. It's just how it is. It sucks.

I've tried twice now over a month. I've never played any music, done anything, it just insta-bans me the moment I try. I was just trying to broadcast fixing a piece of audio equipment &gt;.&lt;

Actually there isn't even any violations on my account \*at all\* in the support inbox, or anywhere and yet this keeps happening!

When I tried to post about it too on the help forums the first time weeks ago I was INSTANTLY banned for a month from it, and my account was perma-banned and I had to send a picture to unban myself but I'm still banned from the help forums and I can't even figure out how to get a hold of any kind of customer service!

This is the second time I've been blocked from the live feature and I can't even tell how or why when I get no chance to even use it. Or why I was banned from the help forum a split second after posting a question asking for help.

I even tried to make a new account and then delete the old one but the new account was instantly banned too. IDK WTF is going on.

The only thing i can think of is that I did use a VPN for a bit but I had turned that off some time ago and I had added everyone who sent me requests for a short while, that's about all I can think of tbh",facebook,submission

1584,kv6exp,Has the old online booking system been removed from the Facebook Messenger app? I used to be able to manually do it via the Pages manager app on my phone or via the website directly on my computer. Any help would be appreciated!,"Hello.

I run a local business and am using Facebook for some of my customers, in which. For the past 2 years I have been using their online appointment booking system which allowed me to easily book my customers through Facebook Messenger either by the Pages App on my phone or on the website from my computer.

Recently this feature was no longer working, and has now gone completely.

I've contacted Facebook about 4 times about it and after a seemingly waste of time of a chase through my settings, which hadn't changed since I made the page. Apparently it's all good. Even though the button is no longer there for me to make appointments for my customers.

I can book appointments via the calendar. Although, this isn't what I need. Especially since it won't go directly to the customers inbox!

I've searched Google using multiple search terms to find the answer, and they're all the same... ""Facebook appointments via calendar""

Kinda annoyed because as I say, I had been using it for the last few years and it's been extremely useful because it sends a reminder the day before so they know when I'm due to arrive.

Now I'm having to manually type everything to them, I may as well convert them to mobile Text like the rest of my customer base and ditch Facebook all together if this system has genuinely been removed.

Anyway, apologies for the Long winded post, I've spent hours now trying to find answers to no avail. Perhaps someone here could help me out?

The old booking system used to look like the following screen shot I've sent. The button to make these appointments used to be where the pound (£) symbol is now.

By the way, I know they can book them selves in... I'm looking to book them in myself since that's what I was doing before and I don't use third party online booking systems/calendars to sync up. It prevents double bookings that way. Plus I don't have enough customers via Facebook to justify the needs for it either.

1602,kvbeh1,Losing Friends After Deactivating a Facebook Account and the Anxiety That Comes with It,"I probably shouldn’t be so concerned about this, but I deactivated my Facebook account over six months ago and I’ve noticed in that time period I’ve lost over ten friends. Typing that out it sounds kind of ridiculous, but I’ve been getting a lot of anxiety over it. 

I deactivated it for personal reasons and to take an extended break from Facebook. I think the way they handle it by leaving an inactive profile without a picture in people’s friends lists is incredibly flawed. 

If I deactivate my account I want it to be frozen. That is, I want it to be the exact same when I return to it. Not missing friends, likes (which was surprising), etc. 

The way Instagram handles this is much better, since a deactivated profile completely disappears from the platform until it’s reactivated. If the profile is reactivated, then it can’t be deactivated again for a week — which is also better since it prevents people from popping in and out. 

I get the temptation for people to remove inactive accounts, since I’ve also noticed a growing amount in my friends list and I had considered removing them without realizing those accounts may or may not return. But I figured there’s no harm in leaving them other than inactive profiles cluttering the list. 

Maybe Facebook does it this way so users return to the platform as soon as possible, since it essentially punishes users for having an account deactivated. But it still bothers me to no end that I probably won’t be able to figure out who unfriended me, since I value every connection I have on Facebook perhaps more than I should. That’s just part of the anxiety that comes from these platforms I suppose. It almost makes me want to delete my account altogether, but creating a new profile and adding back the 500+ friends I do have would be almost impossible.",facebook,submission

I don't have a Facebook account under this specific email so I thought it was odd at first. I just ignored it as spam/phishing/etc and deleted them when i saw them.
Yes I suppose I could have created a filter to block Facebook related emails but regardless. 

I then started to notice the amount of notifications to build up, followed by friend recommendations for people I know and/or those in my contacts, most through WhatsApp.

This got me concerned, so today I decided to look into it more. I opened the first email regarding Facebook I saw, which looked fairly genuine. Probably not the best idea to open it possibly being sketchy but I was willing to take the risk. 

It seemed to auto forward? me to the Facebook Web app through Gmail and it turns out there is an account open under a name that isn't mine. It seems idle, with no friends, no posts and the same number of unread notifications that match the latest email. 

I don't know what's happened here or how it has either?
Is it possible I accidentally opened a Facebook account somehow? 
Could someone else have opened an account using my email? 
Should I log out of the account? Or even try to delete it? 
Could someone have or had access to my email in the past to do this?

I’ve filled out all of the account recovery/ID confirmation forms and have not received a response from FB. Any guidance would be appreciated.,"If anyone could help me resolve this issue I’d be extremely grateful. I’ve made zero progress thus far:
So recently I had a phone number change, I changed it on FB and received confirmations that my old number was removed AND that my new number was added. I changed my password a few weeks ago and they sent a code to my current phone to confirm it was me changing my password which I DID receive. Well after the password change before I got fully logged in it prompted me to “log out of all devices” I clicked yes just to be safe. However, after I typed my new password in it asked for my two-factor authentication code, which was not being sent to my phone, email, or any my contact info linked with my account. I’ve tried many times over the past week– again and again I do not receive the code. But it still sends the code to my phone to change my password when prompted. 

I’ve sent in the account recovery form multiple times where you have I provided a drivers license as ID– no luck, not even as much as a response from FB support. Is there any other form/page/advice someone could point me toward that would help me make any progress here? 

Again, I’d appreciate any help at all even if it doesn’t entirely resolve the problem. I’m willing to try about anything. With that said, obviously I’m not giving out my user/password/any personal info. I don’t want an account I’m locked out of to become a hacked account I’m locked out of lol but thanks to everyone for taking the time to read through this.",facebook,submission

The issue is that this Facebook account has been ""temporarily disabled."" I attempted to recover the account, in which they requested to give them some sort of ID. This would not have been a problem except for the issue that the Facebook account name does not match my name (it was supposed to be a throwaway account so I could store the information of the game account). I ended up giving them a picture of my driving license, only thing is that I am worried that I won't be able to recover my account again because of the names. Just to contextualize, the game account that I lost is worth $100+, and this is the ONLY way to recover my account (I contacted customer support of said game and they told me to get the login into the Facebook account and get the account back).

This being said, will they still give me back the account? If not, is there a way where I can contact customer support directly so I can give them some context about the situation? Thanks in advance.",facebook,submission

Hi,

When I was 12 my friend started bullying me physically and mentally. She was also spreading rumours and had been really rude to my family. She blocked me from everything and i got really sick and was off school for a year while doctors were trying to figure out what was wrong with me, so I couldn't ask her what had happened.

I know it is really stupid but I made a fake profile pretending to know me to try and ask her what had happened. Being immature and really sick at the time, I don't think I was very nice. I dont think I would have said anything really mean, but I am really embarrassed that i would even do that.

I deleted my account after about a week but 10 years later, i am extremely distressed about it. I am so worried that somebody will find out that it was me. I can't stop thinking about it because I know the messages are still there.

I messaged myself on the account to cover myself if i got blamed. I have been reporting it to facebook but no action has been taken. I don't know how I can explain the situation to them to get the messaged removed as 'abuse or spam.' I am so ashamed of myself and i dont know how to move on. I can't stop thinking about it, its consuming my whole life. I just want the messages removed. I was mentally unwell, immature and I am so ashamed",facebook,submission

Mods deleted original post because its title wasn't ""descriptive"" and that ""you have 300 characters"" (original title was ""Breaking: Facebook's January 6th New Blanket Ban""). So I copy-and-pasted the content of the article to the title. 

At roughly 8:30 pm EST on January 6th, 2021, Facebook issued a new blanket ban on what could easily wind up being millions of accounts. We're getting non-stop reports of people who don't even use Facebook any more having their accounts effectively frozen, all with identical timestamps and identical 30-day bans. It appears to be purely and nakedly politically motivated, and it seems to affect wholly apolitical and unrelated business accounts on shared networks, indicating a network-level IP ban. If your account has been mysteriously suspended until February 5th, you aren't even close to alone, and the article below goes into finer detail as to the nature of the ban.

I saw other posts talking a blanket ban that was implemented on Weds, but that it has mainly affected conservative/conservative-leaning users. Well I'm far from conservative, haha.

The variance in who was featured, the topics presented, and the date the posts were made varied much more widely than usual. In addition, my feed went from 1 in 3 posts being political to something closer to 1 in 20. No news articles. Hardly any business postings. Almost entirely individuals talking about the most inane topics I've seen on their pages. Went in and out a few times but it has remained the same this evening.

Also can't find any recent online threads about this issue.,"This problem regards my second Facebook profile which I want to give up for deletion due to personal reasons. Therefore I requested to download certain archives so I can back-up the personal data that I still wish to keep.

Up until now, I haven't been able to open or extract **ANY** of the created .zip-files. I have been able to do this succesfully in the past, so I don't quite understand why this isn't working out right now? I'm assuming it's a bug from their side and I have already reported it. However, I don't exactly have the time or patience to await an answer from their side ...

Can anyone help me out? For the time being I've deactivated my profile.

**STEPS THAT I'VE GONE THROUGH SO FAR:**

1. I selected ""high media quality"" and ""HTML format"" when I requested to download my selection containing the various archives of my preference. *Please note that my requested files are already significantly smaller in size since I'm not in need of my Facebook pictures and videos.*
2. Facebook then made the compressed file (.zip) available for download.
3. I tried to open and extract this file with Windows Explorer/7-zip/WinRAR. These programs either stated that the archives are empty, that the archive isn't an archive or that the format is unknown and/or damaged.
4. After this I redownloaded the file, thinking something might have gone wrong while downloading it. \[This didn't do anything\]
5. Then I re-requested the creation of a new compressed file with the same selected archives. \[Didn't work either\]
6. I then thought that I might have selected too many archives all at once. Maybe it didn't work because my file was just too large. I then requested the creation of a .zip-file with just the archive of my friendlist. While attempting to open/extract this .zip-file the same errors kept appearing as they did with the above mentioned .zip-files.
7. A friend then asked me if I was able to open any other type of .zip that was on my computer. I coincidentally had someone's handbook in a compressed file which I was able to open and extract succesfully with any of the programs that I've used for my Facebook .zip. This was just to check whether any of my programs/apps were corrupted.
8. After some online research I tried fixing all these Facebook .zip-files with the repair tool in WinRAR. \[Nothing changed\]
9. I then used Yodot Zip Repair \[Zilch\]

What the hell am I supposed to do? I'm quite tech-savvy thus it can't be THIS hard to obtain my personal data ... Feeling pretty frustrated at this point, please help meeeee!

Here's the full story: I was hacked into all of my accounts a few days ago - Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, Ebay, Paypal and more - just all accounts were hacked. Fortunately, I was able to get almost all accounts back and of course the first thing I did was activate the 2-factor verification and choose an even stronger password. In addition, thank God nothing was debited, ordered or sent money into the world from my bank accounts. However, two accounts were still hacked - Facebook and Instagram. 

Here we come to the exciting part of the story:  As with all other accounts, I also changed my password on Facebook and started a verification to prove that the actual owner (i.e. me) can regain access to his account. Finally, Facebook wanted to verify my authenticity using my full legal name and my ID card and sent me to the following address:

**- https://de-de.facebook.com/help/contact/260749603972907** 

I gave my ID card details/photos and my name and let Facebook 2-3 days time to unlock my account again. Curiously, Facebook then completely deactivated my account instead.  Now I don't even have the opportunity to start a new check, because then a message window from Facebook pops up, telling me: 

**""Our decision to deactivate your account cannot be verified. Your Facebook account has been deactivated for violating our community standards. We have already reviewed this decision and will not be reversing it.""** 

I currently don't see any other way to win my account back than to start this cry for help and hope for your help. Facebook has neither a contact form nor a telephone hotline. Just an imprint email to which they don't reply. If someone has contact with Facebook, knows a solution or can somehow manage to reactivate my account including Instagram and make it usable, I would be infinitely grateful to you! 

I think it's a real shame that someone hacked my account, did some mischief (I don't even know what was done because I can't see anything) and the account was blocked. My verification with my ID got rejected by Facebook and all contact options are blocked. 

I don't know what to do other than let it go viral so that Facebook gets wind of it itself? I don't know what helps. I am asking you for help! Thank you for everyone who does something and helps! Thank you for your help!",facebook,submission

2020,ksqwpk,Potential Facebook imposter account. Has anyone experienced this before?,"Hi, 
As weird as this may sound, I think people I went to high school with have an imposter who has friended a lot of people in our “group”. 
This guy about a month ago out of nowhere claimed to have graduated class of ‘92, joined the high school’s alum page and literally everyone started getting friend requests from him. 
I didn’t remember him so I didn’t add him but my wife got a request as well (who didn’t go to the same high school) which raised my suspicion about the guy.
I started asking around and everyone gave the same response of “I don’t remember him, but I saw he had so many mutual friends I recognized so I just added him”. 
I noticed with the current political climate, he is posting in the more conservative-type conversations really over-the-top stuff while concurrently in the more liberal ones, he’s following suit but with a real liberal opinion.
I made a couple of people aware that this whole thing is odd and some people have posted publicly to the guy, “hey, sorry but I don’t remember you, how do we know eachother?”, and he’s gone completely silent. 
Believe it or not this same thing happened a couple of years ago with a random girl posing as everyone’s friend but without the political slant, and was called out after a couple of months and disappeared.
Has anyone experienced this or heard of it? What could be the motive for something like this?

2034,krefyo,Why is Facebook imposing the new page update on one of my pages but not on the others? I would like to avoid making this update as I am not convinced by its features.,"I will try to make this as clear as possible.

I  have a Facebook page and recently Facebook offered me to switch to the  new version of page, which is a suggestion I ignored since I'm not  really a fan of their page updates. However, since December 31st 2020, I  believe, this update is now imposed. I have to activate it if I want to  continue posting. What bothers me about this update is the fact that,  now people won't be able to see the pages like anymore and only the  followers, which I think is stupid.

I  know there's apparently a way to swith back to the classic version, but  before ""taking the risk"" I wanted to make a test with another one of my  pages I cared less about. However, it doesn't offer (impose) this  option to swith to the new version. Do you know if this depends on the  numbers of likes/followers? I have around 11 K likes on the page that  offers the update and around 1,5 K likes on the page I wanted to use for  a test. Does any of you who have pages recently swicth to the new  version? Is it a good or a bad thing?

3) Be able to use Facebook messenger within a browser or separate FB client app

Are there Chrome extensions or Firefox addons that can accomplish these two things?

1) Video Background Play addon for Firefox DOES work. Does anyone know a Chrome extension that does the same thing?

2) Video Speed Controller addon for Firefox can't be installed on my Android phone. Anyone know a way to install this? Or an alternative addon? As well as a Chrome extension? I used to be able to install the addon to my phone.

Is there a Facebook client app that can allow these things, such as Frost?

&amp;#x200B;

My discoveries:

FireFox - allows background play addon. Still searching for a way to speed up videos. Unable to install Video Speed Controller addon.

Brave Browser (Chromium) - allows background play by default, but doesn't allow installation of extensions which could allow speeding up the video.

Kiwi (Chromium) - allows extensions to be installed but I don't know of any chrome extensions that allow background play and speeding up videos. ALSO, allows messenger to be used inside the browser!

Yandex (Chromium) - allows extensions...

Frost FB client app - doesn't allow background play or speeding up videos. Allows FB Messenger within the app. Is Frost safe to have installed on the phone? Is the spyware removed?

2120,kry8ne,Facebook Enforcement Bots are consistently and inaccurately flagging posts even after human enforcement numerous times verified the bots got it wrong with false positives but the violations are stacking to warnings of disabling my account and page for their inaccuracies. (screenshots provided),"Within a month's time my Facebook account and page have been getting spammed with notifications saying they are at risk. It started some time in early December 2020 and now today I got another. First it was saying something about a warning on my account may eventually become disabled. Then 2 weeks later got a threat saying my account is at risk of becoming disabled. Not even a week later I had my ability to post limited severely in groups so that I can at best post in maybe one time and that is it for the entire day. Now I get notified today that a page I run, not frequently posting but still actively managed, is also a risk of becoming restricted or unpublished.

This has been a common problem within 2020 where bots were flagging posts as spam that I contested or no one ever got back to me as they weren't spam. I looked at my Violation list and it says 6, not sure if that is all that are currently against my account as it doesn't decipher which ones I contested and won that the bot was wrong and which are still in dispute. In total from September 2018 to January 2020 I had 9 violations. Almost all were spam claims that has since died down and no risks or warnings were given until December. Until then there was no problems. Then I had 2 more violations, one in October and one in December. Both were claimed for going against Community Standards on nudity or sexual activity, I contested both because the bot was clearly in the wrong and both times a human Facebook Enforcement manually reviewed and found both did not violate community standards and the bot was wrong.

I got numerous of these where they said they got this wrong but I'd be posting all day screenshots. And some don't have the original final message where they said at the end that they were in the wrong like October's where I posted a meme about ""The Hub"" getting cancelled by credit card processors. No inappropriate stuff was shown but just because the word was in the meme it was flagged by the bot but the human ruled the bot was wrong.

So I have proven these Facebook bots are clearly getting it wrong numerous times and now its gone from inaccurate community standard flagging to now threatening to disable my page and account permanently. Some screenshots of the FB automated messages I have received. I decided to ask around in some groups and other people are also claiming they have been getting these warnings too recently as well. I have submitted ticket to ""report a problem"" and ""give feedback"" but heard nothing back. Is Facebook enforcement aware of this issue and that bots are wrongfully sending out warnings and threats of closing peoples accounts and pages?

All the violations listed against my page and account are invalid.

My Page-Isn't misrepresenting it's identity or purpose-I am not using multiple Facebook account but it has options to assign page roles and there are other accounts assigned as editor and admin. That is a feature built-in by Facebook for pages. They have had this role for well over a year.-No new accounts were created or taking actions to avoid restrictions on posting etc-I am not making it difficult to know my content's origins or making content seem more popular than it is. Only recently this page as been getting a slight increase in popularity of like 20 more likes in a month than usual so its just more than likely gaining traction.

My Account-Isn't pretending to be another person, real or fake, it is me-I am not using more than 1 account. I just happen to have other accounts on my desktop and smartphone but they are family members accounts and have been for several years. That is allowed on Facebook.-I am not making comments and posts that mislead people

So clearly Facebook needs to find out what is going on with their bots as they are going overboard and becoming super flag friendly ever since like October it has become much worse and I have no idea what changed. It feels as though even after the bot is proven wrong with a false flag, the violation still holds a tally mark against you I feel because my account theoretically should be in good standing with all these false positives verified by FB enforcements own human team saying to bot got it wrong but it feels like the bot violations are over ruling on punishment. And I'm not the only one experiencing this and we aren't getting any word from Facebook letting us know the bots have gone trigger happy on post as of late and need to get reworked or toned down. Even 5 groups I was apart of all got permanently disabled in the last 2 months starting in October including Plasmaposting, Gruntposting, Bugposting, Shaxxposting, Sargon of Akkad discussion group. So clearly there is a problem with the bots that can be seen from both me and my page and in groups I have been apart of getting hit hard known stop since October. Sargon of Akkad discussion group was perma-disabled from the post I made in October that FB human enforcement determined they were in the wrong but the group still remains perma-zucced even though the post was verified to not have gone against Community Standards. Human enforcement is almost consistently siding with me that bots are getting it wrong, something needs to be done about this.

Is Facebook's development team aware of this issue and addressing it? Wil they publicly come out and let people know there is an issue going on with the bots?",facebook,submission

Yes I was SCAMMED, but I didn't loose money (besides the money shipping back). Please take note and learn from my mistake! Advice on how to alert FB is still appreciated.","Moral: DON'T EVER PAY ANYONE YOU DON'T KNOW THROUGH MESSENGER!!!!!!! IT'S AS GOOD AS PAYING CASH.

I paid this lady twice. For a working microwave range. Once through FB Marketplace and once through PayPal. Both I consider to be safe forms of payment. She refunded both times claiming she wouldn't get the money in time. She pleaded, demanded, and begged me to send money through messenger. I told her I was no longer interested I was done. She's like but I already shipped it!

I have pages of communication from her on messenger. She tried 5+ times to get me to pay through messenger. She needed help for her kid and then her water was being turned off. I needed to send the money NOW! I refused. Said I would pay her when the microwave arrived (as she couldn't get interception to work) and I could confirm it wasn't a box of rocks. 

She sent me tons of messages. Making like I was a horrible person for not helping her when she's kept up her side. Claiming she was an honest person who wouldn't take my money for something she wasn't honest about. She was very convincing. I'm still not sure if she really is in such a bad situation. SMH.

I finally got the microwave. Bought a cord and had my dad connect it for me to test (the power cord was snipped to the base). It turns on and sounds horrible. There are burn marks inside. And it doesn't heat. 

If it sounds too good to be true it probably is. 

She begged me to send back and I am, on my own dime. And far better packaged. She didn't apologise and just wants the tracking number. Of course because when she sent it worked and was clean (no soot). SMH

If I would have payed I would have had no protection. Just a broken microwave. I'll be blocking after I send the tracking. Then I'll be figuring out how to contact FB to report her.",facebook,submission

2156,kqu3du,Facebook Messenger on android keeps sending me messages I already received,"So I've been facing this problem on my phone for a very long time and it's getting ridiculous. I use Facebook for some time on another device like my computer, I send texts back and forth and and everything is alright. But when later I turn the Wifi on or mobile data on my phone, I get bombarded with hundreds of notifications of Facebook Messenger messages that I have already seen and/or responded to, so I have to sit and wait for a few minutes for my phone to go through a ton of annoying notification pop-ups, sounds, and vibrations. So it's basically lightning up like a christmas tree. Again, I've already seen these messages, answered all of them, and had full conversations with other people and all.  It's basically notifying me again of every message that hasn't been received on my phone.  Not only that, but when I open the app and the messages are being received, I can the see the Messenger app receiving the messages in real time and, like it's syncing right at that moment, which makes me things even more that it's a Messenger app problem.

  
Here's what I HAVE ALREADY TRIE TO DO BUT DIDN'T WORK : 

* Turn off battery saver mode.
* Turn off app optimization.
* Turn off data saver.
* Synchronization is already turned on for everything all the time.
* Change the browser I use on my computer so that maybe there's a cache problem.
* Clear the data, the cache, and reinstalling both the Facebook and Messenger apps on my phone.
* Search the internet, for hours hoping to find a solution.

None of these seem to work. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy A50 running on Android 10. However when I  read the Messenger app on the play store, it seems like some other users are facing this problem. I also tried to test this out on an older Samsung phone but the problem is also present there. I also checked all the Facebook and Messenger settings that could interfere with this, but nothing worked. 

Please If you encountered this problem before, or you're suffering from it, tell me. If you post the solution to it, I don't have much to give you, but me and some other users will be forever grateful to you, so thanks in advance.",facebook,submission

So I used it through Instagram. But recently I made a Facebook account, because I got an oculus guest 2 for Christmas (thanks to my girlfriend for that!) which needed a Facebook account to make an account for it.

My girlfriend informed me tonight that I couldn’t send me things because I “didn’t have messager anymore” so confused I went to check. I got a pop up that said “is this you?” with my profile picture I slapped on my Facebook account, so I hit continue. Then my heart sank when all of the conversations I had there were gone. Anyone I added, both distant relatives I’ve kept in contact with throughout the pandemic, and my college class message groups with friends, were replaced by an empty void.

I’m assuming it’s because it switched me from using Instagram to using Facebook, but I don’t want that. Is there anyway to change the account back over to using Instagram? Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.",facebook,submission
2228,krakyx,"Since when do things like ""fuck you"" are in the bullying and harassment on social media like Facebook?","I along with many out there, who are probably for freedom of speech and expression, noticed that simple insults like the simple phrase such as ""fuck you"" that you might throw out there on a simple post or comment section over Facebook noticed that is being taken up as harassment or bullying...and, in their views, have no room on that according to their so called community standards.

The punch line and irony here is, not that is only against people who find vulgar speech for example as part of natural language itself and natural freedom of expression and that needs to be respected like basic freedoms of speech itself, but aside that it can be very much abused out there by peers which leads to oversensitised overall aspect of the whole platform, and its so called standards.

Since when did this fiasco started to take place? Given the simple fact that there is always a tool for these types of things at the end of every user, meaning if someone gets offended by these words or similar things they may as well as use the ""block"" function.

This is straight forward outrageous and whoever was behind this idiotic practice may as well as contact a psychiatrist or probably needs to do a psychiatric check, as this only leads to far worst things down the line. Is this an effect of the so called overly offended generation? If it is, then this world is certainly doomed and we are all heading towards a nightmare.

Aside that, as the irony goes forward, is that this occurred over a topic regarding the pandemic and was pointing out the abuse and misinformation and misguiding of peers on the platform. Shortly, the words were directed at someone who was against information of Covid-19 and the individual was actively encouraging the abiding to the laws of the pandemic, when it got called out even with those words that were used and considered vulgar.

Bottom line is, who the heck is in the wrongs and bads here? A user calling a simple name someone using vulgar words for the idiocy he supports and emanates or the idiot who actively undermines a serious situation where lives are put to risk and even death can occur at its impulses?

I  getting sick and tired of these hypocritical practices on social media and I am just waiting honestly for them to pile up and for me to close every contact with the crap called Facebook and affiliates.

The issue is that they set up two part authentication on my account, which I had not set up previously. Now I can change my password all I want but I still can't log in because the account is not attached to any authentication code generator that I have. I do not receive any of the SMS codes either when I try that route so I suspect that they may have put in a different phone number for this express purpose. Anyone got any ideas to get around this?

I could even see reviews I had written for a few pages.  They are public pages though, so I'm guessing the only way I can make them unviewable is by deleting them completely.

I went through each of my old pictures and changed them from 'Public' to 'Friends', but nothing changed when I used the 'View as' function again.

Now, I have been warned in the past for copyrighted music on my personal page. But usually they're background music (posting workout and boxing videos) not allowed in (XX, XX, and XX countries) and as they're seen in the US, I don't really pay attention to it. I have contested a few and overturned them, but because they're always seen in America, I usually don't appeal.

This was the first time on my business page though, and I'm surprised that it got deleted entirely. Boxing highlights are being shared all over instagram with no issue. I even saw the entire fight on several facebook live feeds. I had a quick edit of a clip (a punch sequence from the 2nd round, followed by the sequence in the 7th round) that lasted about 30 seconds that got me permanently banned from Instagram.

Hey, not sure if this is the right place to ask but; 

I almost 100% of the time, use Facebook || FB messenger on my iPhone 7, the software and the apps are up to date. 

My account got permanently banned (long story, not really my fault but there was nothing important on there so not fussed) but I do use it to keep in contact with friends and family during lockdown, so I made a new account with a separate email, and tried to log in on my phone, and was met with an ‘unexpected log in error’ 

However when I try the account on my computer it’s completely fine? I’ve reset settings, redownloaded it, researched to see if there’s a device ban (couldn’t find anything) so I was wondering if anyone could help resolve it? 

I realise this might be like an official Reddit for Facebook, and if it is a ban, I might get an IP ban for trying to circumvent it, but I really don’t care, I don’t use my laptop, so If I can’t access it on my phone I’m not going to use it anyway, so do what you must. 

I know my way around a pc so if the fix is tricky I’ll be able to manage, just let me know!

I am an artist with a large following (over 150K) and do most of my business on FB, which I am now realizing is a HUGE mistake because there is no resource or recourse for problems. No one I can call, no forum where I can get answers, just nothing.   


I actually have two problems, but my most urgent one is being able to get to my messages on my business page. I was doing business as normal, when the page failed and told me to reload it. I reloaded it and then got the message ""Sorry something went wrong - We're working on getting this fixed as soon as we can.""

  
That was a month ago. I get notifications of the messages I am receiving, but I cannot access them - when I click on the notification (or the lightning bolt icon), it just gives me the ""Sorry, something went wrong...""  


I have tried contacting support. Now I do note that this is an option on the error message page, but when I clicl on that link, it says [www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com) refused to connect.  


So I have written support from the ""Help and Support"" option via my page. Three times. No response. I have also posted in the Help community - no response.   


I have googled this until my fingers bled. I have tried the obvious - restarting my browser, logging out and back in again. Nada. I am using the latest version of Chrome - but have tried different browsers and get this same message.

I have also tried:  


Clearing my cache and cookies  


As noted, other browsers.

  
Posting for help via Twitter using u/Facebook  


&amp;#x200B;

Note: I can access \*some\* of the messages  via my phone app, which would be fine but it tells me to see them all, I need to use Business Manager for Facebook. This is my second  problem - The Business Manager for Facebook, unfortunately, does not list my actual business page as an option. It lists every other page I have adminned on or created- but \*not\* my primary business one.    


I previously used the Pages app and loved it. But when I updated to Business Manager, I could not longer get to my Business Page (see above). So I am seriously stuck for receiving my messages and doing business. I  have several messages now from customers which I can't get to. ANd I am honestly terrified that I let a company have this much control over my business and cannot even contact them. Live and learn.  


So please - any suggestions at all are so appreciated. How to fix it, how to get ahold of someone, how to escalate - anything.

Is it possible that our FB accounts are somehow linked? At least through targeted ads.

My wallet was stolen about a year ago. The thief tried to buy $3000 worth of golf equipment but my bank flagged it as suspicious immediately and it didn't go through. What is interesting is that since then I have been getting golf ads on Social Media. Just today I started getting ads for ""Starting a Physical Therapy Business"", and clicking on ""Why am I seeing this ad?"" was very telling. Essentially I can paint a vague picture of this wallet thief from the way out in left field ads I'm getting. I should note that I am not interested in golf at all, and have never studied or even considered going into the PT field. I was targeted with the ad because

1. I am over 18
2. I live in the US
3. I recently viewed a video on said creators page

BUT I have never heard of the creator. I took a quick glance at the page's videos and none of them struck any interest. I don't think I would have watched any of those videos as they were almost entirely related to starting a Physical therapy business.",facebook,submission

The author I was listening to said that even, for example, the number of exclamation marks are noted to read sentiment in the posts/comments. 

If this is the case it would be much more informative than the simplistic “if comment on post by X then add more posts by X to news feed” process.

One of the worst I know of is a small newspaper that hasn't been getting trolled by a person with multiple pages with discriminatory names, day and night. The troll has gone as far as to use the names of regular commenters in his page names. I have reported all of them, multiple times and nothing has been done about it. The main way I believe the troll has avoided a ban is because they have been only reacting, not posting. So, when you look at the reactions to pretty much any article, or comment, there is a bunch of discriminate and racist language. 

Anyone else see these kind of things happening on FB?",facebook,submission
2644,knk1tb,Anyone notice unchecked trolling by Facebook Pages? Anything that can be done?,"Anyone notice people making use of Facebook pages to troll? And that reporting such pages is ineffective? I am currently living in South Korea, and there is an English language edition of a local newspaper that someone has been trolling with Facebook pages for months now. Reporting the pages does absolutely nothing. I think the person primarily avoids detection by using reactions, instead of making posts. But the page names themselves are discriminatory, and at times contains frequent commenters names. For example: https://i.imgur.com/SJ0r9Vb.png

Now before you think, maybe this person is actually responding to some blantaly racist users or posts, they are not. For example, this post triggered the same response from the troll: https://i.imgur.com/Lin6hCi.png

In fact, pretty much anyone who is not Asian will get this response, and if you're Asian and you don't make any Ethnically-nationalistic type posts, for example if you make a legitimate criticism of Korea, or something supportive of the USA, the troll will proceed to react to them with pages calling them a 'banana'. 

Personally, I am pretty sure it is someone with mental health issues, because they have a massive fixation on the Korea Times, and seem to think the CIA is some how involed in this all: https://i.imgur.com/1AEI0Kl.png

And, for reference, this the newspaper: https://www.koreatimes.co.kr, so no the troll is also not fighting against some evil imperialist paper, like the troll seems to believe.

For the last 6 days, Facebook will not remove a disgusting suggested group from my page. The group is called something like ""M\*th Models"" (yes, that) and shows disgusting looking people posting pictures of themselves openly using and waving around paraphernalia. This has NOTHING to do with any activity I've ever had on Facebook. I literally post links to news articles and dumb jokes/songs I like.

I've closed and reopened my app. I've restarted my phone, deleted app data for Facebook, reinstalled the app, and hid the suggested groups post at least 5 times. I've gone to my groups page and none of the other groups suggested have anything to do with people using meth on Facebook. And still, this horrifying group suggestion is spammed onto my page.

I've now reported this group 15 or more times to Facebook for various reasons, from self-harm to  violence. Apparently, there's no ability to report a group for running openly illegal activities and have that taken seriously. I've now forwarded this group to my local law enforcement contact line because I have no idea how to get this group removed from my page permanently if Facebook won't do it.

Short story: I bought a microwave from a lady on FB marketplace. Paid $160 through FB marketplace on Dec. 24th with shipping and tax. No replies this week. Then issues with mailing on the 30th. Then she says FB marketplace payment won't work for her. Then she says she spent her last $30 on shipping plus extra for box. And she refunds my money and ask me to pay via messenger. We'll I got advised from friend there would be no protection for delivery for messenger payments. So I refuse and offer if she'll try marketplace again back and forth. She finally sets up PayPal. I PAY AGAIN $155 she upped the price (the other without tax was less). She returns the money after back and forth. Because it will take too long to get money. I tell her to stop shipment. She can't. She said she'll take FB payment again. Or even half now half when I get package. There's also the fact that the shipping info she eventually sent shows it's in preshippment (carrier hasn't received) still from the 24th. I don't know if this is a scam. If she's actually this clueless (it does seem that way, she's been doing an aweful lot). But also she's tried lots of different things to try to get me to basically electronically send her cash for an item I haven't seen. I've spent a lot of time and stress on this, I'm tired. She's got a sad sob story and I'm a kind person but don't want to be taken advantage of.",facebook,submission

2679,knqxnm,"Facebook suddenly started ""Secure Your Account"" process as soon as i add my personal account into a business site, now the only option it offers me is via SMS, and it doesn't even send the SMS to me.","Long story short, i just bought an advertisement and i was adding my personal account to a business organization that i just created for my site. As soon as i did that, my account was logged out from all devices. When i try to log in, it says :  


&gt; **Secure your account**   
&gt;  
&gt;You started securing your account on **Wednesday, 30 December 2020 at 14:09**.  
&gt;  
&gt;To finish securing your account, please verify your identity and change your password. Your account will remain hidden until you complete this process.

It only offers to send SMS for my account, but it only sent to me during midnight of that day. I tried to log in again, but this time it doesn't even offer that option anymore, it just redirect me to a site where it says :

&gt; **Identity not confirmed**   
&gt;  
&gt; We currently can't verify your identity. Please try again later. 

The only options i got are either log out or read about their security program. It has been like this for a day now. My account can't no longer be found publicly. I have tried the following methods :

1. Log in from another device / different internet.
2. Click on forgot my password, asked 3 trusted friends to provide a code and reset my password, but as soon as i confirm my new password, it says that ""Invalid request"" and my password didn't get changed.

So i was wondering :

1. Is my account toasted and gone forever? Or is there anyway to save it?
2. I'm running an ad on it as well, and i don't know if it's gonna steal my money while my account is being locked like this?

I didn't have access to, or didn't remember 90% of the connected devices, so I thought, ""what the hell, I'll start fresh."" The problem is, I had the Microsoft authenticator app set up for two factor authentication, and I must've uninstalled and reinstalled it since the last time I had to authenticate my login on my app, because when Facebook wants to authenticate, it doesn't show in my authenticator app. I did the recover option where I confirmed my ID, photo of license and all, and have had no response. However, last time I tried to login it sent an SMS code to my phone number to reset my password, and then had the option to check log out or stay logged in to previous devices, either way I click the button on the bottom of the screen says ""log in."" I click ""log in"" and it pulls up the screen saying ""logging in,"" but then pops of the two-factor authentication notice. However, this time is says an SMS with a code will be sent to me, but I never receive a code. I can reset my password using my number or email, but when I login it tries to authenticate through an SMS, but I'm not receiving a code.

Tengo una cuenta de Facebook desde el año 2016. Durante este tiempo hasta el 2020 eh cambiado la contraseña quizas entre 2 a 3 veces. La ultima vez fue porque me llegaron unos mensajes diciendo que alguien estaba tratando de accesar a mi facebook, me parecio obviamente algo extraño, la cambie y como siempre mi Samsung pass, me dice ""Guardar contraseña"" Oh dios. Claro que si... La fatiga que me evito poniendola... Sin embargo al no tener la necesidad de estar ingresando la contraseña la OLVIDE. Cuando reviso la contraseña de mi Samsung pass: xxxxxxx la copio y pego al navegador en la pagina del Facebook y me lanza pass incorrecto. Es decir cuando me logeo con mi huella, y se rellenan los espacios de LOGIN. Entro perfectamente. Sin embargo cuando coloco manualmente los caracteres me sale que el logeo a sido incorrecto. Aclarando este punto tengo acceso a mi cuenta de Facebook. Sin embargo no puedo accesar desde otro dispositivo que no sea mi celular.

**Recuperacion:**  
Facebook en todo su esplendor le falta un servicio de atención al cliente. Si hablamos de recuperar mi contraseña con alguien de servicio al cliente es como decir que el propio Mark me respondera.

Cuando intento recuperar mi facebook me salen las opciones que todos aca conocemos:  
**Correo o Numero de telefono. Oh vaya sorpresa! El numero de telefono que tenia con esa cuenta ya fue desactivado debido al poco uso que le daba**. Por lo que la opcion del celular queda descartada. 

Si hablamos de correo electrónico no tenia enlazado ningún correo electrónico por lo que igual estaria descartado.  


Cuando por fin tengo la ocpion de recuperacion mediante un ""correo"" Tengo mas de 4 meses esperandolo.

&amp;#x200B;

**Problemas dificiles requieren medidas estrictas.**

**Estoy aprendiendo a usar Phishing PARA AUTO ""HACKEARME"" sin embargo tendría que rellenar el login manualmente cosa, que obviamente me tira error.** 

Para finalizar les deseo un año nuevo.. Busco respuestas claro, pero tambien puedes echarte unas risas con esta historia. Ni una cosa ni la otra... Estoy bien jodido...

Hello there fellas

My mother had a problem with her Facebook account (one of them) earlier today. She's not very computer or phone savvy, and I'll be quoting what she said has happened, as well what I did and observed as a result of the problem.

So she said that she was browsing the Facebook Marketplace trough a Facebook Lite app on her phone. At some point she gets ''an error message''. At this time she still has her mobile data on and the home's wi-fi on. Since she doesn't understand much, she assumes both being on causes a problem. She turns off the mobile data leaving her only connected to the wi-fi. A loading circle appears on her phone and a bit after that it supposedly says, and I'm quoting (well the quote might not be exact, since I'm translating from another language. What exactly would be the message if her phone and apps were in English, I don't know) ""Error fixed. Do you want to exit?"". And she clicks exit. After that point her profile appears to no longer exists.  
She tried the forgotten password option, but then it says that the filled information is not connected with any Facebook account. I open Messenger on my phone to try to write her , her profile is still in my list of contacts but the message cannot be delivered. It says ""One or more of your recipients are not valid. Please try again."" I also opened Facebook through my PC, she no longer exists in my friend list, and her profile cannot be found.

Anyone has any idea what's going on?",facebook,submission

When I searched up her profile on facebook, nothing came up, I tried to search her new profile pic, thinking that maybe she is still friends with her parents, but her profile is nowhere to be found. Also I had taken a few screenshots of her impostor, before they managed to disable it. Searched on the google image thingy, and found out that the girls on her new profile picture is on a dating app, somewhere in the UK. The pictures look like stock images so I don't suspect the actual girls on the picture, maybe some BOTs did it? We have no idea on what to do, we tried the customer support, but the facebook help tab is useless in that regard. Any tips or help would be greatly appreciated. 

**The screenshots I took:**

2999,klzh54,"My Proposed Rules of Etiquette For Buyers &amp; Sellers on Marketplace--Descriptions, Prompt Responses","In the past 2-odd years Facebook has all but replaced Craigslist as the place for second-hand shopping--at least in my area. Compared to FB Marketplace, Craigslist is practically a ghost town. I do quite a bit of buying-selling there, and here are my personal guidelines for etiquette. I will put in each one whether this is a rule for a seller (me being a buyer) or a buyer (me being a seller).

(1) Seller. BE SPECIFIC about the product and include an ample description. This goes especially with computers, there's big difference in a machine that's only 2-3 years old and one that's 8-10 years old. RAM, the CPU being used, hard drive space, whether it has USB 2 or 3, all of those are important. If you don't understand those terms, then have the model number ready so I can look it up and find out for myself.

I'm using an old computer with 4G of RAM and don't want anything with less than 8G or even 16G, I also don't want anything older than Windows 8 preferably 10.

In like manner, if it's a car I need to know if it has a 4 or V6 engine (unless it's a Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla where you know it's a 4). 5-speed or auto, regular auto or CVT (especially with Nissans, as those are notoriously prone to failure), INCLUDE this information in your ad from the get-go.

(2) Buyer. Speaking of #1, I'm fine with most questions, but read the ad. ""Is it a standard?"" It says in the ad AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION. Read the darned thing.

(3) Seller. No holds. OK I get it, no holds, but if I'm on the way, I'm on the way. DO NOT sell to someone else who gets there first if I am in fact on the way &amp; have told you this and given ETA. I understand not waiting around all day and prioritizing who gets there first, but once I've said ""I'm on the way,"" you WAIT and give me a chance. Once I've pulled out of the driveway and am on route &amp; you know this along with an ETA, you have no business selling to someone else.

(4) Buyer. In the spirit of #3 I will not sell out from under you if you're on the way, but I also have the right to sell to someone else who inquired after you if it's easier on me. If they can get here quicker vs in several days, if they can pay the way I prefer, I reserve the right to sell to them rather than having to sell to you first because you contacted me first.

(5) Seller. This is the big one. Stop taking all freaking day long to answer an inquiry. This is ridiculous. We're not in the paper checks and micro-cassette answering machine era. Unless your mother is in the hospital for a heart attack and your phone died unexpectedly, there is no reason for it to take all freaking day long to hear anything back. Like Seinfeld said when complaining about someone not calling back ""maybe they're out of town"" he said ""they don't have phones out of town?"" That was the standard then, that's the standard even more now that we have cell phones. That is my expectation, and I'm sticking with it.

No you don't ""have a life and am not glued to my phone,"" because when I send a message ""you're never selling a product by taking until the end of the Ice Age to reply to someone"" or post to the ad itself ""apparently it's sold and the seller is just rudely ignoring all of our inquiries"" then all of a sudden you're not so busy anymore.

We get it, you work, you're in school, you're ""busy"" organizing your collection of Teena Marie action figure Styrofoam plates--whatever. Taking an hour or even a couple, ok--all day, nonsense. You posted an item for sale, an act that is ASKING PEOPLE TO CONTACT YOU and then acting all aghast and annoyed when they do because you're apparently some backwards-antisocial introvert who doesn't wish to be disturbed. Onions. You want to sell something, reply to people, or don't sell anything at all until you can.",facebook,submission

Unfortunately, there is no safer option like PayPal — only a credit card is accepted. I don’t know if this is in itself a warning to stay away. There are so many comments on her page that I figure at least some might be actual customers...well, I hope so, anyway.
Part of me says that Facebook would not openly allow someone to scam people like this if that is what she’s doing. This is a public page all can see, not some person you have to friend request or whatever.

The other day, our IG account was locked, I'm guessing due to someone trying to log in with incorrect password, so they forced us to change the password.  All went smoothly as far as I could tell, so I continued to schedule our holiday break posts through Creator Studio.

Fast forward to Christmas morning and I realized our post didn't go up on IG, and then I realized the scheduled post from the day before had not gone up either.

I have no trouble posting directly from my phone but all scheduled posts to IG through Creator Studio give me an error message saying the post couldn't be posted or edited.

I tried disconnecting and reconnecting the IG account from Creator Studio - which turned all of my scheduled posts into drafts, the least of my problems if it worked - but it didn't work.  It's reconnected and appeared to log in fine but I still get the same error message even if turning the drafts into new posts and scheduling them and waiting for them to post.  They don't.

https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/kkq6ks/deleting_facebook_and_transferring_page_ownership/

As many have decided at one point or another, I am permanently deleting my personal Facebook profile. I've had it for almost 15 years now, and frankly no good has come of it. Or, it's an overall net negative.

Only current things I need it for are:

1. Oculus VR account
2. Managed Business Pages and Groups

So, here is what I figured. I'll create a separate account with a different email address that has no content or connections to anyone else, and I'll change my admin ownership of any pages/groups to the new account.

Did that without too much issue. I was able to access all my pages from the new account.

Oculus account will be trickier. Doesn't look like they give you a way to transfer ownership. So, I will simply delete my existing Oculus account and create a new one linked to the new Facebook account.

Thankfully, all my VR Games are on SteamVR and I didn't use Oculus account for any purchases.

So, I delete my Oculus data and mark the account for deletion.

Deleting or Deactivating my Facebook Profile seems to be an issue. I'm currently getting [this](https://i.imgur.com/RJ0awGd.png) message.

Now, when I try to sign back into my new Facebook account and I get [this](https://i.imgur.com/dXgschL.png). I guess it was flagged as a potentially malicious account? Hopefully they don't give me a hard time about it.

Anyway, so that's where I'm at right now. I still need some FB access so I can continue to manage my business pages, but personal profile can be deleted.

It's almost like Facebook doesn't want to lose people posting. this is harder than it should be.

And I'm realizing now more than ever how much of an issue it is for Facebook to have their hands in so many pots. This will affect Messenger, Oculus, Whatsapp and probably my Instagram as well.",facebook,submission

I had posted two photos, one was a ss of what got me zucced and the other was a photo of me and my cat, both I tagged my main account in so that my friends/family could see.

Either than that all I did was post cat memes into the group I'm admin of (I made that account a moderator). All the info that facebook gave was ""your account was disabled for going against our community standards"". No other reason. And of course, I can't repeal this or get support in any way.

Why for FB?," I use my 2 yubikeys at several sites (eg google accounts) and just today I decided to establish them on my fb login. For the first time I was ""asked"" by CHROME to first enter a PIN. I backed out w/o completing the setup as I wanted to be sure what was what.

I recall that the only other time I was asked similarly was when setting up these same yubikeys for 1Password a year ago. I did use a PIN as a one off as I was never requested to do so again.

Is it for sure that the PIN being requested for the establishment of these keys for FB is the same PIN I was requested to set up when first 'doing' 1Password?

I run a Facebook Page for a local community. I've spent months trying to allow users to be able to post directly onto my page, but it doesn't work. I've gone into Settings on the Page and clicked the checkbox to allow visitors to publish posts.

But when a user tries to publish onto the page, it doesn't appear. It appears in my Notifications section on the page, but I've no way to make it public. There's no option I can see to approve it.

Any ideas what's wrong here? Should I have set up a Group instead of a Page?

My wife got me an Oculus for Christmas, which I am very excited about, though I have now learned that you need to have a Facebook account in order to use it, which I am much less excited about. I actually deleted my Facebook account earlier in 2020, after having barely used it for years (unfortunate timing I suppose). Now I have tried to create a new account with my same email address, as well as two other attempts with new email addresses, and each one was immediately disabled upon creation for not following the 'Community Standards'. My prior account did not have any issues or flags when I deleted it. Is this just a Facebook grudge for me previously deleting my account?

Apparently, looking this up its not that uncommon but I woke up to a text for a facebook security code. Tried to access my account from my phone. Everything changed. Logged onto my computer. Changed.

Tried the 'forgot password' thing but it's now linking to a new email. Tried 'another way' which then links to a new phone number. Back and forth, back and forth. Whoever designed this 'verification method' is a real idiot.

I logged onto my original email and lo and behold I had both, ""You've changed the email of your account"" &amp; ""You've changed the password of your account"". I've followed these through and was able to put my original email, &amp; of course changed the password to that too (I considered completely changing the attached email but decided to keep the same email, just in case, I didn't want to put another email on the hacker's radar).

I was shown through my more recent activity (friend requests, comments, posts, etc) to verify my things and delete things that weren't.. All good except the hacker's email was still attached. Ok, I'll just completely remove it once I log in.

PROGRESS!

Until now the 2 step verification page. Which can be accessed on my facebook account on my mobile........

But although I was able to put in my correct email and password, I was THEN sent a verification to the updated (read: hacker's) phone number.... and now back to square one.

Hate to admit but my brother's account got hacked a few months ago and he didn't even have the original email so he just gave up after this nonsense back and forth and just made a new account. I don't think I care to make an entire new account at least not for a long while but I do use it for events and the messenger so this is really irritating.

Please help.

And a couple other situation there was a buyer message complaining about the shipping being slow and then they were given refunds

Facebook is implementing seller fees starting 2021 starting at 5%.

The hacker has since changed her email and password. So fast forward to two months later, she told me about it and see if I can help. She tried recovering via Facebook's recommendations/support guidelines and failed. I tried as well and realised how stupid the system is when you tried to report a hacked account. They direct you to recover your account via the hacker's email, asking you to log in to the account using the hacker's password or through the verification code that is sent to the hacker's email, which is impossible. She also doesn't have an alternate way (e.g. email address or mobile number) to recover her account.  She tried to send two different forms of IDs on two separate occasions (national ID and passport) and both replies she got were that they need to ""receive an accepted form of ID that matches the information listed on the account"". She is Chinese with a Chinese and English name together as her official name but she only used her English name as her Facebook displayed name. One of her IDs has her English name on it and the other doesn't. She has photos on both her IDs. At this point, we have exhausted all options and do not know how to recover her account.

I just had nose surgery, and I sent a selfie of my nose cast with no blood pictured or anything. Just me with a tan thing on my nose, nothing graphic at all. Then this morning my account has been disabled, and I don't understand why. I didn't harass, send graphic photos, or post anything offensive.

However, when she tries to log into Facebook it still says her account is banned because her Instagram is banned, even though it is no longer banned.

This has been happening for two weeks now, and there’s numerous threads on the Facebook subreddit made by people who’ve been dealing with this for months. The only solution found so far has been to do a hard reset on the iPhone.

I Had to delete Facebook to make room for a stupid iOS update because there was a glitch where I had no free storage - post-update I had over 40GB free so I re-downloaded the apps I offloaded or deleted and they’re all working normally now with the exception of this Facebook glitch. It’s infuriating. I can still login on Chrome on the phone, and messenger but cannot onto the actual Facebook app.

EDIT: Ok, so I just did the reset because someone tried to hack into my account and I had to change my password which logged me out of messenger and then the login error began on messenger too which had been working fine until then.So I got home from work and did a complete factory reset of my iPhone. Upon the set-up process I selected backing-up from iCloud, but there are only two backups available to select. I used the oldest one which was only from 12/16. The other one was 12/20.This whole process played out and then when Facebook re-downloaded I attempted to relog into both it and messenger, and neither one is working still. Same error message.HOW DO I FIX THIS!?!?",facebook,submission

I wanted to assign a username to my fb page. I messed it up and assigned it to my personal profile. I realized I messed it up so I changed the username of my personal profile to a random username (as you can't just delete that username) so that the username become available again. I tried to use the username for my fb page and it says it is not available even though it IS available cause I type [facebook.com/username](https://facebook.com/username) and it's empty.

3858,kg9se4,"My uncle's account got hacked. Recieved no email or notifications- email address just suddenly changed. How can he take it back? (Advice needed, please help!)","Greetings from a college student in Hong Kong. As the title says, my uncle's Facebook account has been hacked. His account was created from 2008, so that's a lot of sensitive information- and the account is now posting some Vietnamese posts right now. I'm scared that my family's information (including his daughter, my 8 yr old cousin) will be leaked. So here's the scenario:
His account received a password reset on last May, out of the blue. He didn't do anything, but was unable to log back in ever since. He thought it was some faulty bug and created a new account.
Yesterday, the account came active, changed icon and started posting some Vietnamese posts (and tagging some other Vietnamese people. I'm really really scared if they would share his information to strangers). I check the account's email, and unsurprisingly, it was changed to an address nobody recognises.
Here's the catch: he did NOT receive any email changes in his original email. Facebook's Q and A said that if his email was changed, he should've recieved an e-mail which can reverse the process-and clearly that did not happen. He received nothing, not even recovery emails.
What's even more stupid is, when you look up Facebook's help manual, all there is is under the assumption that the email is still linked to the account, which. Is. NOT. In. This. Case.
What should he do to recover his account? Does anyone with a similar experience can share your aid? Thanks!!",facebook,submission

I have had a Quest 2 since black Friday that I haven't been able to use it.," I had not used my Facebook account for a couple of years until I tried to log in with my Quest 2. I had to do password recovery being I do not use Facebook and that somehow triggered ID verification. I sent ID (scan of Drivers License) on the 27th of November and waited. 8 days later I received an email saying,

""Thanks for submitting your ID. However, we can't confirm your identity until you provide an ID. ""

I sent the ID again not sure what the heck to do. A couple of days later I tried to log in and go through the ID submittal process again. This time it wouldn't let me upload the scan because it wasn't minimum 1600 x 1200 pixels. That would have been nice to know in the first place.

So I took a photo of my DL and submitted that.

Finally, yesterday, I received a lovely email stating the following:

""Hi,

We can’t give you access to this account or help with your request until we receive an accepted form of ID that matches the information listed on the account. Learn more about the types of ID we accept in the Help Center:

I had my wife use her account to verify my info was correct on Facebook and matching my ID.

I am at a complete loss. It is ridiculous that someone who simply had to change their password because they hadn't logged into their Facebook account has to wait for an unknown length of time to get access to their account to use a piece of Hardware! I cannot find any way to contact support for help.

At this point, I have submitted every form of ID I have to Facebook in hopes that I can get this thing set up for Christmas for my kids.

Lastly, I did reach out to Oculus in hopes that they could help. They responded within 48 hours, but have not provided any direction at this point.

Somehow It's Auto-Posted Not Once But Twice.,"I saved an article posted by VICE (popular media outlet) and Facebook instantly gave me a warning for ""going against community standards"" and trying to post something I wasn't supposed to. Problem is, I only *saved* the article...I never tried to post it to start with. Okay, I accepted their decision because I had no other alternative. They warned me I'd get a temp ban if I did it again.

About 30 minutes later, I get kicked out of my account because of the same article! It auto-reposted by itself. HOW IS THIS HAPPENING?

During the same interval, FB told me a picture I'd posted yesterday was added ""45 minutes ago"" so I know it's something funky going on with the site. But if I get a 3-day block because of their screw up I'm gonna be pissed. What can I do, and how can I prevent this weird article from auto posting on my page after I go to bed or something? That would be even WORSE.  I decided to ""appeal the decision"" the second time just to see what would happen so I'm scared it will be approved and post to my page in the night.  As of now I can still access my account even though it said I was banned for 24 hours.  

Thanks in advance. This is downright creepy. I checked and the article is no longer saved to my 'Saved Articles' archive thing, if it ever was. I'm on a Chromebook if it matters.

When I post a link to facebook, e.g. [https://www.cnet.com/news/monitor-os-x-launchagents-folders-to-help-prevent-malware-attacks/](https://www.cnet.com/news/monitor-os-x-launchagents-folders-to-help-prevent-malware-attacks/), and I share this link via Android to a user on FB messenger, the link is not clickable by either the sender or the recipient.

Whereas if I share this link from a web browser to messenger, it works on both sides.  What the heck?

the sharing debugger doesn't surface any issues, but now that I think about this, I have seen this issue for a while.

[https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Fnews%2Fmonitor-os-x-launchagents-folders-to-help-prevent-malware-attacks%2F](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Fnews%2Fmonitor-os-x-launchagents-folders-to-help-prevent-malware-attacks%2F)

I tried this with multiple different links and it was the same for all of them.  is this some kind of feature or known issue?

edit:

What doesn't work:  
\- Sharing any post via android share to messenger. You cannot open the link as the sender OR as the recipient.  
\- Forwarding any link within messenger via android. You cannot open the link as the sender OR as the recipient.

What does work:  
\- Sharing any post via web browser to messenger.  
\- Forwarding any link within desktop or browser messenger, even links that were sent via android originally.  
\- Viewing any post in messenger in a browser or in the external desktop app.",facebook,submission

Before that, it was for a meme of some sort, don’t remember, but had no offensive content. I appeal and appeal and nothing happens.

4136,ke1b5r,I got my Facebook account back after being disabled for no reason with no warning. Here’s how. Here is also how to protect yourself from this happening to you and what to do if it does.,"‪A few days ago I posted on here about how my account was disabled for no reason out of nowhere, citing that I did not follow community standards. I own an ad agency and spend thousands with them each month. They not only jeopardized 13 years of my life in photos and connections, but also my livelihood. Here’s what I did:

First, I appealed the disablement with the form they provided. I submitted my info along with a pic of my DL for proof of identity. I was only able to do that once. It wouldn’t allow me to submit again. I then emailed accounts@support.Facebook.com 8 times with my DL for proof of identity, along with receipts of the thousands of dollars I spend per month. 

I also took to Twitter using #facebookdisabledme and sent several tweets/retweeted @facebook, calling them out. I suggest doing this as well, if anything to draw their attention to what’s happening to so many. 

After sending the receipts my account was up again within two days. ‬(The whole process of getting back on was about 4 days.) The only emails I got back from them were automated responses, so I am simply hypothesizing the idea that the receipts are what did it. However, they’d be fools to disable an account that pays them well over $12K per year, but who am I to say? 

Also, one of the posts I went off on them for on Twitter was the one that says “Small Businesses Are the Heart of What We Do” or some similar bs. Literally the biggest farce I’ve ever read, considering how many people are still waiting hopelessly to get their accounts back. Comment on that tweet if you choose to comment at all. 

After my account was up again, I got a message in my “support inbox” with an apology saying “Sorry. We made a mistake,” citing a comment on a post from March that they said “violated community terms” (which obviously did not - the comment simply contributed to a zoning conversation, agreeing that my home town didn’t need another dollar store). 

HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF

First of all, if you have a “business manager,” or “ads manager” account, add someone you trust (or multiple people) as an admin/s (i.e a parent, sibling, best friend, etc.). This way if your account is banned, you can still access your business manager/ads manager through them, and you won’t be left up shit creek with zero access to your or your clients’ business endeavors. 

Second, the AI bots are out of control and the customer service is nonexistent. Do yourself a favor and THOROUGHLY READ THROUGH THEIR COMMUNITY STANDARDS. (Simply Google it.) When I say thoroughly, I mean where it says “Read More” under the main headings/descriptions, do it. That’s where the real details and examples are. I did this after being disabled to see if there was anything I did to qualify for being banned. I learned that you can literally be banned for calling someone an idiot or stupid. (How 99% of fb users are still active with that rule is beyond me.) The rules, sorry “guidelines” are unbelievably strict — they basically seem to be written to be able to justify banning anyone for anything. 

Watch yourselves. Facebook is a private company. They can do whatever tf they want. If you truly value your memories or that platform, do yourself a favor and just be polite. Don’t post political shit (that’s on their list, too), don’t be a dick (or even say that phrase), don’t do anything that could cause them to ban you. The few seconds of power you feel for “putting someone in their place” or venting about the world with your opinions is NOT worth losing a decade + of memories, connections, and/or your business model. 

Or ignore me. I do realize this sounds like I’m screaming “cater to Big Brother,” and in essence, I am. But if you choose to ignore me, don’t whine about it later when you’re banned after telling a Karen that she can eat shit, then wonder why you can’t log in anymore. (Heads up: “eat shit” is one of their no-no phrases, too.)

If you’re like me and have been playing it safe all along and still get banned or disabled, re-read the above for what I did to get it back. Not 100% sure it’ll help, but definitely worth a try. 

Good luck to all of you!",facebook,submission
4137,ke1flh,Desktop messenger has just got worse and worse,[removed],facebook,submission
4138,ke1ic5,"Desktop messenger has removed features each update, and is nearly unusable now compared to its older versions. Why is that?","Every time they change the desktop site, the messages get worse. Notable changes I can remember:

- I stopped using facebook.com for messages becasue of annoying notis from the social media, so I swapped to messenger.com

- messenger.com now has a 70ish% chance of failing to send photos. You can fix this by using facebook.com/messages/t/

- they changed facebook.com/messages/t/ to now have the notifications bar, and you get notification pop ups while using messenger on it

- They just totally removed polls and events. It took nearly a full year to get polls back, and events are nowhere to be seen. Why??? These were features my group chats used *all the time!*

And now the recent ""update"":

- Anywhere from 1-10 second hang time when changing between chats

- The chance of photos sending is now totally luck based. Sometimes it refuses to, sometimes it works fine.

- Receiving/sending messages doesn't scroll the page down. Sometimes the website freezes for like ten seconds before you can see new messages (including your own) 

- You have to click the burger next to a photo to click ""reply"", but not for normal messages. It takes up the same amount of space!! Why??? Just leave the arrow there!

- YOU CAN'T CLICK THE WHITESPACE TO SELECT THE TEXT BOX! This is the most frustrating one!!! It used to be you could basically click anywhere in the tab and start typing (like discord) but now you HAVE to click the bar at the bottom of the screen.

- If you have the info bar open, [it covers half of the message box if the window is snapped.](https://imgur.com/a/5QfqJ6v) You can close it, but when you fullscreen the window then the screen is horribly stretched and you have to reopen it again. Annoying if you're swapping between the two.

- You can't search your messages anymore?? Just totally removed the feature...

- They moved the ""add people"" button to the bottom of the list of names instead of it being in the other section, so if you're in a group chat with a lot of people it takes aaages to get to the bottom and get it.

- Videos always autoplay and are muted, but don't unmute when you click them. You have to  hover over and click the volume button, set it to the right level, and then move it back to the start and press play. Just... start them paused... and play with audio when I press play.. please...

- You can't view old photos in a grid anymore. You can only have the carousel or scroll down the image history in rows of three.

- Minor one lol but it turns :3 into a cat face emoji, even though it stopped doing that for a while. 

Most of all, I just can't get over how much slower it is. They also unified messenger.com to be the exact same chat client, so it's not even an alternative to messages/t/ anymore. It shouldn't be faster for me to go and get my phone to just use messenger normally...  I know the majority of fb users are mobile, but it seems ridiculous to update the desktop version *just to make it worse!* What features have they even added in the last five years?

And before people ask: I have a high end pc, good internet, and several of my friends share these issues. It's not just me.  I would happily move all my group chats to discord, but it doesn't have features like the messenger bubble on mobile, and some of my less tech literate friends/family just don't understand it at all. Facebook is much more ubiquitous.

tl;dr: Messenger on desktop gets worse every update for seemingly no reason.",facebook,submission

So first off, Hi, this is my first post ever on Reddit. I was content to be a lurker who mostly used Reddit for its nsfw content, but Facebook has forced my hand and here I am. 

Nearly a month ago, my Facebook was hacked. No big deal, right? Except that my recovery email was an old one I don’t use anymore and didn’t have access to. I thought I had updated it. Okay, my bad. Except Facebook doesn’t give you options for if your recovery email is not accessible. As a last ditch effort, I submitted my Drivers License and waited. And waited. And waited. Meanwhile, my credit/debit cards, which were linked to my account were charged multiple times, despite me reporting my account as hacked. To the tune of eventually over $300. You might be wondering why I didn’t cancel my cards the first time -  oh I did, but somehow the new card got linked to my account (without me adding it) and charged again. I don’t even fully understand how that happened. The whole time I’ve been locked out of my account because I need to log in to generate a code to enter that code in order to log in. Do you see the problem?

I’ve been reporting and messaging and asking friends to report my page as hacked and Facebook has been silent.  As you might already be aware, there’s no direct way to contact the company, so I’ve resorted to using a variety of platforms and tagging them in post to try to be heard by somebody.  I don’t think they give a damn anymore about our little problems with their platform since I’ve realized there are hundreds if not thousands of others in my position. The fact that I’ve been reporting the issue for a month with complete radio silence is ridiculous, and if anyone else has been through this, I really feel for you because it is not fun. Frankly, it’s enough to make me want to quit Facebook altogether. That, or make a better social media platform. I’ve had it with Facebook, and 
I guess this is a last attempt to reach someone before I have to go for nuclear options (figuratively of course).

TL:DR My Facebook got hacked and despite multiple attempts to get help they have done nothing so here I am.",facebook,submission

 2. ""Violation of community standards"" I posted asking if anyone knew of a good local gun range. This is not against the rules.

Just before I start, I just wanna say that I was already able to access my Facebook once again through my email and using Facebook's 3-step verification system. I just wanted to know why I got locked today.

So, to start it off, 2 weeks ago, I got my Facebook hacked through a kind of virus chain message that I opened. This hack basically sent the same virus I got sent to around 300 people. After this happened, I changed all my passwords on Facebook, email and other accounts connected to Facebook. After this, I felt safe again with my account, I also became more cautious at opening links on messages.

However, around an hour ago, while I was chatting with my SO, my messenger suddenly got logged out and I tried logging in but couldn't. My SO then messages me through another app and told me that something happened with my Facebook again. Apparently, all my messages became unavailable and my account was gone and could not be searched (I was lost on his friends list as well), basically seemed like it was deactivated, but not by me. I was able to receive an email from Facebook regarding this activity and received a recovery link, at first the link did not work but eventually it did. I went through Facebook's 3-step verification system to recover my account and thankfully, was able to. After recovering my account, my SO told me that everything was back to normal now. I also, checked my posts and messages and nothing seemed to be posted or sent by a hacker, so now I think it was Facebook who locked me out of my account (maybe due to my account being hacked last time), but then is Facebook even capable of doing that?

That is all I believe, also, is there something that I could do to make sure something like this would not happen again? Thank you.",facebook,submission

So then i created a new account and tried to forget about it. A couple days ago it crossed my mind that the photos, message, games and all of the good memories that my hacked account possess started to irritates me. I've been trying to get back to that account, but since the email was changed and i dont know what the email is, i cannot recover the account.

First proof is obviously the name matches. I can verify it with my Government-issued ID.  


Second proof is that when you go to about &gt; family and relationships, my mother's facebook account is listed as the account's mother and i can verify it 100% since my mother still use facebook regularly (screenshot attached).  


Third proof is back in 2011 when i created a new account since this account was hacked, i messaged my old account basically showing emotions since i just got hacked (screenshot attached).  


I have visited [https://www.facebook.com/hacked/](https://www.facebook.com/hacked/) and tried to recover from that but since the email was changed by the hacker i couldnt do a thing about it. I have tried many options but still no progress.  


I was thinking since my old account listed my mother's main facebook account as the mother i could ask my mother to recover it with her account (as shown in here [https://www.facebook.com/help/231208473756221/?ref=u2u](https://www.facebook.com/help/231208473756221/?ref=u2u)) but no, she couldnt. I still need to know the email which only the hacker knows.  


This is truly my last hope in recovering that account, looking forward for answers, thanks.

(the last time the guy has usually been the one to update his status but even then it’s given me the choice to approve, before published on my timeline.) 
So can someone please explain why when I changed my status yesterday it literally tagged and shared on not only my wall but also the person I tagged/requested without him even accepting or approving pending request... 
When I woke up this morning to a bunch of notifications from even people I don’t know... and instead of questioning ‘with who’, from people on my list .... it was congrats and a bunch of other wonderful comments, likes, and hearts, from people/friends on both our pages...

Last night I was attempting to link a Shopify account to my Facebook account and for some reason it triggered an alert with their AI making it think someone was trying to hack in to my account. They sent me an email and had me change my password. When I logged back in, I was told I had to confirm my number and submit an ID. I did this, but now I'm getting the message saying my submission is under review but due to Covid limiting their staff size, it might not be reviewed???

I have an 11 year old account, with pending marketplace orders and at least $500 in pending payouts. After reading what others have said, I'm really worried I'll never be able to get my account back, nor will I be able to open a second one.

Has anyone else recently dealt with this and actually had their account unlocked after submitting their ID? If so, how long did it take?",facebook,submission

I did not know about this infraction until January of this year when I created a FB business account. Within a week the business account was restricted from the advertising tools from the FB business tools.

I attempted to appeal this several times, but about 4 months ago when trying to talk to FB's chat support I was informed that it was a final decision to disable my ad account and the decision would not be reversed.

I attempted to create a new personal account, but that was deleted for ""violation"" within an hour of it being created.

Fast forward about 3 months from that and I deleted my 10-year-old account and created a new account (this was 2 weeks ago).

I waited for 24 hrs after created this now 3rd account before created the FB business manager account. During this process, I found that the FB business page that was created by the first account was also flagged.

So I tried making a second business page...24 hrs after the biz page was created, the 3rd personal account was deleted for the same ""violation"" the second was deleted.

I again tried to appeal this decision, but they said it was final.

I have no idea what to do now...does Facebook blacklist people for some reason.

All because of some repost I put up in 2015?

Facebook has disabled my account and won't say why. I generally post very boring things: here's a picture of me with a friend smiling. I don't post things that are racey and most of my posts are somewhat dull.

No one seems to answer my emails. They said they will review things, but I'm 99% sure they won't. They probably just requested a photo so the AI can ban me with facial recognition?

For now, I'll just create another account and I won't use any pictures or similar info so the AI doesn't flag me.

Oh, and there was no warning. I've never had a community standard violation before. No explanation. Just nothing.

Pretty crazy how they are doing this to people. I manage a few business pages of my own and for clients. Now my own will be dead since no one else were admins.

I strongly believe my account was mistakenly blocked recently (which was not hacked as far as I can tell when I checked from my mom's account.) I've been using my account for nearly 10 years now without any issue what so ever. I rarely post on, as I mainly used it for reading and viewing photos and messenger. I think the last time I actually posted was in 2013, a photo when I met Dennis Anderson at a monster truck show. Other than that I occasionally comment on a family or friend's post and that's it, just friendly, benign stuff.

The only thing I could even remotely think of could be one of the two apps I had been trying on my phone (Maki and Phoenix) to evaluate which one works better, or possibly with the Facebook messenger plugin for Pidgin IM that I use on desktop; one of those might have some how triggered something the servers didn't like perhaps.

I had sent my official ID but still haven't head back. Instead I was greeted by a message stating ""*Your Facebook account was disabled because it did not follow our Community Standards. We have already reviewed this decision and it cannot be reversed*""

I did receive a rather vague email from a *case++aazqexwvofamnp@support.facebook.com* stating ""*Thanks for contacting us. We've reviewed your account and confirmed that it still doesn't follow our Community Standards. As a result, your account remains disabled.*"" to which I replied again, along with my ID attached (after looking at the email headers) but haven't heard anything back.

I also tried sending a direct message to @Facebook on Twitter after I saw a mention on a site I found when searching for other ways to contact FB, but haven't received any reply there either.

It is incredibly frustrating when I know I haven't been doing anything even remotely malicious, where I'm just slammed with a block completely out of the blue, without any sort of explanation or description what they thought the problem is, no information what so ever.

4795,kak37w,"I'm planning to create a new Facebook account. How do I merge multiple social circles. Friends, Family, Old Classmates and Coworkers that all know different things about me and might not get along? [Long Post]","I'm planning to create a Facebook account soon, mostly to fulfill the requirement to use my Oculus Quest 2 VR headset (you need an active Facebook account to use it). But I've been wanting to create a Facebook account anyway for a while now. I'm not great at staying in touch with people and have lost contact with a lot of friends and family over the years. 

I've created 2 Facebook accounts in the past. The first I created was in 5th grade, around the time when Farmville was a thing, and I really didn't get into the social features at all. I played Farmville, and when I stopped playing Farmville, I stopped using Facebook. A few years later one of my family members noticed that I misspelled my own name on the account. 

When I moved between states, I came out as gay and didn't bother to tell anyone in my old home state. I have a very Catholic family and went to a catholic school. 

When I started highschool, in the new state I was living in, I decided to create another Facebook account. Intentionally separate from my first, where I could be open about my sexuality. To hide my account from the people who knew me in my home state, I used a different first name. Naming myself cringe-inducingly after a Disney character, but keeping my last name. 

I didn't play any games on this second Facebook account, and attempted to use it for its social features. Honestly it just felt like a chore. 

Since then, I've tried logging in a few times now, and can never really stay committed to it. It's just boring to me. It *is* a chore. 

I'm too self conscious to take photos of myself, I never like how they look. I don't travel, I don't go out, I took 1 semester of community college and was stuck in a job that I hated for 4 years. Currently I'm trying to improve on things. I got a new job, before Covid started I started going to the gym and I plan to go back to school in the fall. I don't want to advertise to everyone that I'm still trying to get my life together. All of my friends are happy, healthy and dating. Facebook feels like a giant mirror reminding me how far behind them I am. I know that's kind of an illusion, the social media effect, but I'd still feel compelled to put myself out there when I'm not really comfortable with doing so. 

The last time I logged on was at least 5 years ago, and I remember getting bombarded with messages from people asking how I'm doing and what I've been up to since we last spoke. It felt so overwhelming. I want to get back into contact with those people, but I've never felt like I had the energy to do so. 

Now is the time to do that I guess. 

My only contact with family members from my home state was through my grandmother. I'd call her and she'd tell me how everyone was doing. She passed away recently, and with that, I don't have any other way of staying in touch. 

I have no contact with friends from grade to middle school, and what little contact I maintained with my friends in high school is deteriorating. One of my closest friends is moving to Washington soon. 

I want to stay in touch with all of these people and to get back in touch with people I haven't spoken to in years. 

Currently my plan is to create one brand new Facebook account as a nice clean fresh start. I may go back and review my old friends lists, and see who I should add to this new account, and delete my old accounts if possible. 

But I don't know who to friend on there or how to balance the different people that I know. There are some who still don't know I'm gay, and many others who do know. I have family members, friends from gradeschool, high school, and coworkers, and I don't necessarily want those different groups of people mixing.

I did a search and this same post was STILL there. I just deleted it manually. This just makes no sense! If the post is offensive enough that even after a claimed review you still ban me - why wouldn’t you delete said post? That’s how it worked in the past.

They asked me to verify my identity, but immediately said they could not verify my identity. It's a quirky infinite loop I can't escape.

They email me ""someone else has logged in to your account"" and send me the login link but I can't use it. I can't figure out any way to recover my account or contact facebook support, no email, no similar cases to report. There's no way to tell facebook ""I don't need your security, please give me your account back"". I couldn't understand, they just locked my account without consulting, had no recovery option and said it was for helping me secure my account?

20 years of internet use. I have never seen a company consider customers as animals as facebook. Without any respect, arbitrarily do everything without consulting customers. My account is not hacked, no one has a passwork, I don't need security, please return my account.  
Thanks if someone helps me get my account back. This account I have been using for 2 years, unfortunately there is no real name, I don't remember the date of birth that I wrote down, but nonetheless there is no option to get the account back.

I always dismiss it, because I don't want to use these features.

But I've noticed that posts like this nearly always get record low engagement, often none at all other than my own likes. This has been true both of posts on pages, and posts on my own news feed.

I noticed it particularly glaringly recently, when I posted something that wasn't even directly asking for money, but rather, just posting a brief thank-you post acknowledging three recent anonymous donors. Normally, any sort of brief, positive post like this gets good engagement. The post got no likes other than myself, and when I reshared it to my timeline it only got 1 like, which is from a person who subscribes to my feed in notifications and generally likes all my posts.

This contrasts glaringly with the normal level of engagement on my posts. I don't post frequently, but engagement is consistently high. For example on this page, my most recent posts had: 9 likes / 2 comments / shares, 6 likes / 3 shares, 7 likes / 1 share.

On my news feed the contrast is more dramatic. Other recent posts got 19 likes / 14 comments, 23 likes / 3 comments, 5 likes, 27 likes / 12 comments.

Now, I know it could be that people just don't like or want to see fundraising-related content in their feed, so they don't engage with it.

But I'm wondering if there could be an additional factor at play. Facebook clearly recognizes certain posts as fundraising-related, using certain keywords, because it displays that banner at the top of them. And then when I clear out of it, those posts never get any engagement. And it makes me really suspicious.

I'm curious if other people have experienced anything like this, and if you all have any theories or evidence one way or the other. I tried searching extensively on this but I couldn't find any mention of this topic which is why I decided to create this post here.",facebook,submission

Today I got a 7 day restriction for posting my own sexy pics with literally everything covered but I was alluding to sex. However I have a friend who invited me to a group where men post sexual images of women with huge tits without their permission. 

So facebook just isn't ok with WOMEN posting pics of THEIR OWN BODIES in anyway that alludes to sex but men can post flat out sexual images talking about what they'd do to the women?! 

Community standards are a great thing but how is it ok to say all women lie about rape (27 accusations against a man is just women trying to get him canceled) and that libtards should be killed and religious people can talk shit about trans and gay people but we can't post images of ourselves that seems TOO SEXUAL? thats a matter of opinion whats ""too sexual"". 

It says ""no sexualized slang, hints or suggestive speech.  No language that describes sex or arousal. No sexual tantric or erotic messages."" Wtf thats half my feed!!! Plus I'm a fucking adult and only have adults on my feed. Seems like it can get out of control to allow opinions to be a part of standards. 

I wanted higher standards so people couldn't talk shit about lgbtq or threaten violence. Ive reported porn before and been told it doesn't go against standards. Porn stars and models have their own pages. Only fans models have their own pages. Men get to post claims about ""lying ass females"" but I cant post something they consider SEXUALIZED? when will bikini pics not be allowed any more? Where does the line get drawn?

I can't count how many days I have worked on trying to get my accounts back.  I am beyond desperate.  My personal Facebook account was hacked in April, and before I could even attempt to reset my password, I was met with this message:

***""Your Facebook account was disabled because it did not follow our Community Standards. We have already reviewed this decision and it cannot be reversed.""***

I have never violated any community standards.  I don't understand how my account was hacked and reviewed by Facebook (incorrectly) over the course of one night.  I’ve been a member of Facebook since 2004.  My personal account “Dan Frieber” was the sole admin of my business page “Tango Chile Sauce”, and now without my Facebook account I cannot buy ads or sponsor posts or advertise my business or anything.  I also lost my instagram account @ frieber because it was linked to my Facebook.  It is like I have been suddenly deleted from the internet.  I have lost thousands of followers and friendships.  For no reason at all.

I have not been able to get in touch with anyone at Facebook since this happened.  None of the online tools can help me, they are all dead-ends.  **I am begging someone to please look into this.  Please help me get my accounts back so that I may retake control of my business.**

My Facebook ad account number was 22379139.   I have more info upon request.

Please help.

Facebook is very important to me because there are a lot of people I can talk to there only and it was the best platform for finding new people. For this reason, I'm pretty sure I haven't broken Facebook's rules.

One fine morning, I open Facebook and see that my account is blocked!

I was asked to send my documents. Some time after sending, when I try to authorize, I receive a message:

Your Account Has Been Disabled

You can't use Facebook because your account, or activity on it, didn't follow our Community Standards.

We have already reviewed this decision and it can't be reversed.

I tried to do a lot. I created new accounts (different IP), recently even bought existing accounts, but everything is useless. My accounts are being blocked.

Then I read that this is due to the political situation in the United States.

Many people have faced this problem. Moreover, I know a person whose Facebook business account was blocked for no reason.

And now my question is:

What can I do?

So, I created another account with the email domain matching the business.

Yesterday when attempting to login I received a message stating that yet again the account was disabled, and I would need to send a photo for confirmation, which I did. Today upon attempting to login, I get a message that the account has been disabled, their decision cannot be reversed as I didn't follow community standards.

I cannot imagine what standards I would have failed to meet, as this account uses my real name, and I have not made a single post or comment on any page. How can I get an account going, as I need to take over this page from the person no longer associated with the business?

I had a potential customer message the Facebook and seem confused about the ordering process and also what we offer. This confused me because to my knowledge, this information was clearly available and we’d never had this issue before. After looking, I noticed the pinned post was missing. 


I scrolled down to where this post would have been initially posted to see if it had somehow got unpinned, but I could not find the post. However, the post can be found if you go through our “photos” section. This isn’t helpful for re-pinning because you can only tag, update location, edit, or delete the post from the photos library. I simply cannot find the post anywhere else. 


Is the only resolution reposting the policy and feeling a little spammy to be honest considering this post was just made and also advertised in October?

I've tried on multiple browsers and different computers but it seems that the issue is tied to my account (my wife doesn't have any of these issues and can login without issue on any device).

Because of this issue I've been managing my ads for my business exclusively through IG. Well, today I go to run an ad and I see a warning on the final ad creation page that states, ""You can't create ads or promote your page because it's restricted from advertising"". Which is ridiculous because I've never violated any community guidelines. Anyway, there's a 'learn more' button underneath this warning so I click it and leads me to a FB login screen (which I obviously can't get into due to the issues mentioned above). 

I'm trying to see if anyone has this same issue or a solution to this issue. Idk if I'm just stuck and I also know it's pretty much impossible to reach a human at FB to try and get this resolved. So, any info or guidance would be greatly appreciated.",facebook,submission

5297,k7eyko,Not getting Notifications for event invitations (Facebook Help Community is fucking useless),"I once received 5 event invites from a Facebook group belonging to a place, where I no longer live. I clicked the ""more actions"" button on the notification and disabled event invites, thinking I was just disabling event invite notifications from this one person or this one group.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh no. Not at all. What happens is that I no longer receive any notifications for event invitations at all. 

  
I have checked ""Settings &amp; Privacy"" -&gt; ""Settings"" -&gt; ""Notifications"" -&gt; ""Events"".

On this page, everything is turned ON.

  
I have checked ""Settings &amp; Privacy"" -&gt; ""Settings"" -&gt;  ""Blocking"". I have NO friends on my restricted list, I have NO friends  blocked in blocked users, and I have NOTHING AT ALL in the list of  ""Block event invites"".

&amp;#x200B;

As far as I can tell, this is a bug with the system. I have searched extensively, and found only very few people with the same problem, and their questions haven't been answered either.  
I asked the question in the Help Community, but that place is a fucking bad joke. Nobody reads, replies or even gives you the false hope of something being done.

Theres an option to report the photo and its taken more seriously I think if you're under 18, i'm over 18 currently but in the photo I'm like 12, is it allowed for me to mark that i'm under 18 since i technically am in the picture?",facebook,submission
