Account Disabled by Facebook - what might be the reason behind the disablement of my account? Any help will be highly appreciated.,"Hello to everyone around.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm facing this problem and i thought Reddit might be a place where i can find some answers or possible ways to recover my account that Facebook just disabled for no reason at all. I recently created a new Facebook Id and then created a Page for my online business. But Facebook was okay until the creation of it all and then suddenly, i got a message that my account is disabled because it was in conflict with the Community Standards. I was shocked because i never even posted anything to both to my Facebook profile and the page. To secure my account i activated 2 step authentication and tweaked the over all account security a little bit. Facebook never even bothered to tell me what actually was the reason that compelled them to disable my account. The point is i had that unique username that i can not have because Facebook decided to disable my account.

Any ideas how can i recover my account?

&amp;#x200B;

i have tried sending a message to [Disabled@facebook.com](mailto:Disabled@facebook.com) but they haven't replied yet or maybe they aren't going to reply at all. Any gurus out there? I'll be thankful if anyone can share any solution to this mess.

Regards.",facebook

Can't log in to access code generator,"Hi. My FB account got hacked 3 days ago and after finding out, I went through the recovery steps to get it back. It seems the final step is to enter a login code that I can get from a code generator. When I google it, it seems the only way to get to the code generator is to log in first. So I feel like I am stuck in a loop. Can anyone help with any suggestions? TIA",facebook

Unable to Link Bank Account to FB Marketplace,[removed],facebook
Still unable to access my Facebook acc after the mass logout and I’m not sure why,"Tried changing the login info and sending an id photo and I’m only able to login to Facebook through the website, please help",facebook
Facebook Will Not Allow Me To Submit my Bank Info To Link My Bank Account To My Marketplace Account,"For the past 3 days, I have been repeatedly trying to connect my bank account to my marketplace account so I can ship items I already sold. No matter what I do, Facebook will not properly accept my bank account information. I have double and triple checked my routing and account number to be absolutely 100% I entered it correctly.

I tried multiple browsers and 2 different devices, however it still will not work. On my laptop, when I click on the button to link my bank account, nothing happens. The page goes unresponsive and the window does not open. When I click that same button on my phone, however, it does guide me to the correct screen to enter my account number, routing number, legal name and address. I enter it 100% accurately, however Facebook guides me back to my ""your listings"" page and presents me with the same link to 'link my bank account'. This causes a continuous loop of entering my bank info, and then being led back to the same button that is telling me to link my account. I have been trying to resolve this for days, and I have customers who will not receive there products on time because of this Facebook error.

I would be very appreciative of any assistance you guys can offer.",facebook

Facebook Checkpoint Password Loop from Hell,[removed],facebook
"Unable to login to Facebook, being sent around checkpoint loop repeatedly, no response at all from Facebook ""support"".","In December I decided to have a security / privacy checkup on FB, and removed old app and device permissions. I thought a password update could be good too, and every day since then I have been stuck in this highly unentertaining loop:

* I log in with my most recently created password
* I go to the checkpoint page and get told I need to secure my account:

https://preview.redd.it/h3klw7qtdxd61.png?width=658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab080f08316605349ec134733662b40d802675ec

I click ""Get Started"", go to to the next screen:

https://preview.redd.it/fr3dlyntdxd61.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb1f84684ac2e7d8db643cc0094a526c2d943bdc

Then onto the next screen:

https://preview.redd.it/9f9x0zptdxd61.png?width=696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=569854270f0b2d79cae1475a701d13eacfc4e818

Then I get an error screen:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/21gi9k46exd61.png?width=650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75c5d0f71e25cb8da987739ec4456ff92827f592

* If I click Continue here, or try to enter another password, I get told I have been logged out.
* I then have to go back to the login screen and start the whole process over again, same result every time.

The password I change to is being stored somewhere as, if I enter my last password before the most recent change, it tells me that I updated my password X minutes / hours ago and to login with that.

Password resets seem to work up to exactly the same point, so I get a code to enter but then get taken straight to the secure your account screen. This is the same on different PCs on different networks, with adblockers turned on or off, private browsing on or off, VPN on or off.

I have attempted to contact FB about 10 times using their contact form that they don't read, and am at a loss. I have a business page that is receiving enquiries and hits that I cannot respond to but, because I don't spend $1,000s on advertising nobody is interested in helping me out.

I know similar issues have been posted here, I'm just wondering if anyone else has had THIS issue, and how it got resolved?",facebook

Ppl that dont have Facebook can still join using a link BUT they have to download the messenger app, then go BACK to the link and click a special button that will allow them to join the group. If they dont do this, messenger will continue to ask them to log in. 

But if they use their computer to join, theres no issues. 

I also googled that ppl have trouble screen sharing, where some ppl cant see the screen share AND there is no audio during screen share. 


So now Im considering using zoom. I dont want ppl to have trouble joining and then trouble during the “party”. 

With zoom I will have to pay $15 to allow the call to be a full hour.

Of the people who were banned on the 22nd, how many of you were hit with the ""Complex Interactions"" ban in late October? How many were hit with an unexplained 30 day ban to their account and messenger on Jan 8th?
I was hit with both, both without any reason as to why, then my account was banned permanently on the 22nd.

Has my account been permanently or temporarily disabled?,[removed],facebook
I received a message from Facebook saying my account has been disabled. But has my account been permanently or temporarily disabled?,"Has my account been permanently or temporarily disabled?

Yesterday I got a message from Facebook saying my account has been disabled. It said:

Your Account Has Been Disabled
You can’t use Facebook because your account, or activity on it, doesn’t follow our Community Standards.
If you think we disabled your account by mistake, we can take you through a few steps to request a review.

Then it says that due to COVID-19 there are fewer people to review all requests. I submitted a review &amp; it wanted me to submit my driver’s license, so I did. Then I got another message saying the same thing about it talk longer to review my information.

But what concerns me is that my license has a different last name than what was on Facebook, because Facebook had my stage name. Will this affect the outcome?

I had 3 strikes last year, which had never happened ever in the 8 years I used Facebook. Once in June or July (which was 3 days) another in August (i think that was a week) &amp; last in November (which was 30 days). Do those 3 violations from 2020 carry over to 2021?

I accidentally deleted my page months ago because I thought I could recreate it in another account but it seems it is not possible to get back the url of the deleted page,"Hi all

I need a suggestion for how to recover a page. I have my personal account and I created a page with (example) URL \_facebook.com/mypagename. After some time I created a secondary account only dedicated to this page (as a company page) but, due to my inexperience I stupidly deleted the page thinking I could recreate it in the other new account the same page with the same direct URL \_facebook.com/mypagename. Unfortunately I discover that once ""reserved"" a URL name (in this case ""mypagename"") is not possible to use it anymore and the alternative I can have are something horrible like ""mypagename\_123123"". I tried to google around and found some form in facebook support to submit request for help but never received reply. It's been several months now and I still haven't been able to find a way to get the URL back because nobody of support reply me. Now i understand that to move a page from one account to another i have to set up the new administrator and delete the old one but if i can't get my url back it's useless.

I use Facebook how I want to to use it. I had 1 or 2 friends, but that is not why I use it. I use it for entering contests, when necessary, and for commenting on websites that use Facebook for such. I also want to use it for business purposes. One day I tried to log into my account and it said my account was disabled due to suspicious, or possible bot, activity. I honestly do absolutely nothing suspicious. I do tend to report spam in comment sections as it bothers me, however.

I try to confirm my identity after I log in — it says ""Help Us Confirm It's You"" — but the link ""Continue"" is grayed out and non-functional.

I tried creating new profiles but it immediately says my account is disabled after confirming my email. So, anyone with my name and birth date does not exist, according to Facebook!? What do I do? I do not want to to put false information so that I can use Facebook.

Is there a way to see if someone logged into your account in the past (and that is NOT currently logged in)? I can't tell if it's a hacker or an autolike.,"I logged in into a very old account of mine after months of inactivity. I emptied it a long time ago (except for private posts and a few groups) and changed the name to a very generic one.

I went to the activity log thing and... it says a couple of days ago I liked an Anonymous User link, liked another dude's comment and answered my own comment. There is nothing before that up until September of 2019... When I click on those logs nothing happens, when usually it brings me to the post I liked or to my comments.

If the answer was no, I hit the unfriend button.

I felt so much better afterward. It was shocking the amount of acquaintances i.e. people I graduated with, coworkers, someone I met at a party and had a good conversation with years ago etc. that was having a view into what was going on in my life. I think it's a maturity thing too, cause once upon a time I cared about having hundreds of ""friends"" on Facebook. So dumb.

I still get friend requests from acquaintances and coworkers who I've maybe spoken to a handful of times in real life. Also have gotten a few resends of requests from people I unfriended during the purge. I leave them unanswered so they won't keep resending. It's just weird how they think I'm going to want them seeing my posts and photos when in they know next to nothing about me. And in the past, if I accepted them,  they don't talk to me, usually don't even react to posts, just lurk. It's just weird man! 

For example, there is this random guy who is a friend of a friend who's from the UK and I've never met and don't have anything in common with. He's sent me multiple requests (hence why I've stopped declining) and even messages me  on holidays and stuff. I mean, it's nice, but if I don't know you I'm not adding you. Don't care how many mutual friends we have.

Maybe I'm just a recluse but I'm perfectly happy with the friends I have. I don't want any more. Quality over quantity. Just strange how Facebook has really construed people's idea of what a ""friend"" is.",facebook

he had set his FB account up using his phone number to login with, rather than his email, and His phone was connected to his mother’s phone plan, and as of right now he and his mother are no longer on speaking terms. So Yesterday, his mother decided it was a great idea to cancel his part of the phone plan, and cut his service off. So now he’s going to be changing his phone number, and getting his own phone plan, but the problem is now this: He can’t remember what his password for Facebook is, and he needs to change his login information from being his Phone number, to being his email address.

So basically if he logs out, he can’t log back in again because he doesn’t remember his password, and he can’t change his password because his account is connected to his phone #, which currently has SMS and calls turned off due to his mother canceling his plan, and he can’t change his login info to email because again, he doesn’t know his password.

"Is Facebook under attack? My profile got blocked for no reason, well, for ""breaching communiy standards"". All as I was scrolling and it suddenly got locked."," 

An hour ago my profile got disabled and ""my personal data is being reviewed"" because I have allegedly breached their standards or whatever. I never post any significant stuff, just use the platform in the most basic way possible- texting friends &amp; sharing random stuff. Suddenly I get an email that some phone number is linked to my account. The beginning was +84, googled it, vietnam???? Two munutes later, as I was scrolling, my account got locked by fb. My profile still appears when searched, but is blank, according to my friends. Messenger is completely frozen. Friends cannot text me. Changed my e-mail pass, changed my fb pass. Last login was from NY with a given IP.... so the attacker probably used a VPN? Idk, I'm way out of the sphere of IT.

At the very least my profile is not being abused, plus I've had no sensitive stuff in messenger.

"Account was hacked by someone in California. Sent a report to Facebook but still haven't heard back after being told I would receive a reply ""shortly""","Two days ago, I logged on in the morning and found that I couldn't log in to Messenger. I tried all of the passwords that I used and none worked. I then went on the browser Facebook and found out that the password I entered was an old password and my password was changed at 7 AM. That immediately struck a red flag since I was still asleep at that time. I tried changing my password but the recovery email was one that I did not recognize so I know for sure my account was hacked.

After some complication with my email, I managed to log in and saw that someone from California attempted to log into my Facebook and succeeded. They changed the password and recovery email. I followed the link given in the email to secure my account and was able to change the password. However, when I try to log in with the new password, it required me to input a security code for two factor authorization. I don't ever remember setting this feature up so I don't know how to get the code. I don't see it in my email or phone. I assume the hacker set this up to keep my locked out of my account. I sent a report to Facebook about it and was told I would receive an email shortly but that was around 8 hours ago.

Not sure what to do at this point. Do I just wait for the email? How long is the email going to take? I don't want the hacked to find out that I'm attempting to recover my account and then go and change the password again. Honestly, I don't even know why someone bothered to gain access to my account. I have nothing valuable on it. The fact that they changed the password and recovery email proves that they hacked my account purposely and I just don't know what they could gain from it.",facebook

 Last night I found out my account was hacked. I attempted to reset the password and regain control of my account but I found out that whoever hacked it changed the main e-mail address on the account.

New PayPal account added to Facebook Messenger.. Two days later someone fraudulently charged me with tens of transactions in a single day and they’re not showing on my Facebook Transactions? What went wrong exactly?,"Hi All!

I added my new PayPal account (about two months old) to an old Facebook account a few days ago.

Today I noticed they removed tens of small transactions starting from early this morning. They started with a few $5 transactions.. to $10 and then did about 12 $30 transactions before I noticed. I only noticed because PayPal sent me a random notification that they refunded one of the $10 transactions.

I checked my Facebook account (the one with the PayPal tied to it) and none of these transactions show on my Payment history. Does this mean someone was able to add it to a desperate account? 

I’ve disputed this with PayPal and once I get my money back to my debit card I’m going to immediately delete my PayPal account. I’ve also changed my passwords everywhere and will probably go ahead and get a new debit card. I also unlinked Facebook from my PayPal and unlinked PayPal from my Facebook.

I tried unenrolling out of the beta, and loaded in the production version, tried logging in and still no dark mode. Reloaded into the beta and nope, still nothing. I think almost every other app I use has a dark mode, and I do have dark mode if I go through chrome, just not the app itself. Anyone else in the same boat still.

Is it possible/somewhat common for comments to not actually go through when you try to post on mobile?,"Has anyone ever tried to make a Facebook comment on mobile with a picture in it, and had it not go through? Is that a thing that happens?

The reason I'm asking is because I commented a meme on a post someone made, and the next day when I looked back it wasn't there. When I made it it was late and I was half asleep, so I don't think I actually watched to make sure it went through or anything. It was a totally unoffensive meme, nothing that I'd think would make the person want to actually delete it. And I know a couple of times before, especially if it's a post or comment with a picture in it, Facebook lags a bit and I *think* I remember seeing stuff not go through if I close it too quickly.

Verification Process Conundrum: Does API work when Advertising Access is Banned?,"So, like many marketers I'm having issues with verification. Problem is right now I have two accounts (I know, I know), but only one of them is used for marketing. The other one is mostly inactive, had actually been turned off when I started marketing and I only turned it on again to check things. Recently it forced me to start down the path of ID Verification (and gives me 30 days to finish it before it bans my account permanently.) The main thing I need for my marketing account is API access.

Trying to find resources on any of this but I can't, so I'm not sure what to do. Was hoping reddit may have some insight.  


My thoughts on my options are: 

* complete the verification and leave the personal account running, hope for the best
* delete the personal account, complete verification, hope for the best
* delete the marketing account before verification - unsure about whether or not this might put a black mark on my Business Manager, I have colleagues manage it.
* Do nothing, let verification run out, take the ban, and hope API still somehow works",facebook

Locked out for 24 hours for trying to reset my password too many times 😭 Does the 24 hour time limit reset with each attempt?,"
So long story short, I couldn’t remember my Facebook password at all. So I decided to try and reset it (using the 3 special contacts that you set up to give you a code if you ever get locked out). Apparently I attempted this too many times and now I’m locked out of my Facebook for 24 hours. 

I got locked out about 10:30am yesterday and attempted to reset it again today about 10:00am (I got anxious and wanted to see if it would work). It said I was still locked out. So I waited an additional hour which would have put me well past the 24 hour mark and I’m still getting the same message that I am locked out for 24 hours due to attempting to reset my password too many times. 

My question is, does anyone know if the 24 hour lock “resets” with each attempt? Am I now going to have to wait until about 11:00am tomorrow to try again?

"Why, when I send a bunch of images at once to someone in Messenger, Facebook always randomizes the order of the images?","Sometimes I want to send multiple images at once to a friend, but I want them to stay in a particular order. For example, comics, mangas, or any other type of image collection that only makes sense when presented in a particular, fixed sequence. Unfortunately, Facebook will always automatically change the order in which each image appear if I send them all in a single message. So in case of a comic for example, the fourth page can appear as the first page, the first page can be the last, and so on.

The only way to avoid this is to send each image one by one, in the order I want them to appear. This sucks because it is time consuming and boring, especially when I want to send a ton of images.

Why there isn't an option to ask if I want to send them in the order I preseented, or if I am okay with the images being randomized? That doesn't happen when I am making a post on my profile on a group, only with messages. Also, that doesn' happen in Whatsapp, only in Facebook Messenger.",facebook

"Temporary facebook jail for chastising a homophobe and boomer hornyposter among a variety of other things while they're still in the clear instead. As for me, are these warnings and temporary locks permanently on record for my account, or do these flags and warnings expire and go away over time?","For context, earlier this winter my account has been temporarily locked from posting under ""Multiple posts from the last year didn't follow our standards."" Even if it's only a 24 hour lock, it's still annoying. All I did was admonish a couple other people who were needlessly A) spamming LGBTQ slurs B) slurs against special needs individuals C) thirstyposting over a girl guitarist, who wasn't even of age, and yet I'm the one getting a couple strikes instead of the actual offenders who have been freely posting away, instead. 

With that being said, do these flags, warnings, or restrictions ever go away under Facebook's current rulings and I bot handling of things? It literally spat out a decision, just as indiscriminate and as useless as u/AutoModerator after I clicked a disagreement with the said decisions that were said to be in review.

I've recently had my account disabled. I reached out to facebook and have heard nothing.,"Hello!

Our other friends also told us that his instagram has posted several explicit pictures and instagram has also disabled that account.

I tried appealing to facebook by going to their appeal page but upon entering the right information,

\-Email/MObile Number associated to the account

\-Facebook name

\-A copy of ID.

Facebook said ""Your form couldn't be sent"", it didnt tell me why it wont send but instead told me to login to seek more information how to request an account review which is ridiculous since I can't login in the first place.

About copying Facebook Cookies,[removed],facebook
"I've snookered myself with two-factor authentication, and I'm looking for suggestions on how I can regain access.","I have 2FA enabled on my Facebook account. To cut a long story short, I no longer have access to my authenticator app, I did not save any backup codes, and I am not logged in anywhere else. I know. I was careless, and I'm now crying out for help, because I'm completely locked out at the moment.

After numerous form submissions to try to recover my account access, I've had no response from Facebook at all. I've been trying this for almost a year, and must  have made double-figure submissions by now.

I also tried the method whereby you can get your other trusted Facebook contacts to send you a combination of codes to approve your login, but  this failed. In addition, it no longer appears to be an option for recovering account.

Aside from continuing to submit the form to recover my account, or attempting the  trusted friends codes again, does anybody have any suggestions as to how I can regain access to my account? I'm expecting a series of simple ""No"" responses, but I thought it was worth a shot to at least ask.",facebook
"Every time I try to log in, I get the can't-use-this-feature message. I've tried everything the help centre suggests, but nothing has worked.","**Context:** This is a relatively new account. I created it months ago but have not used it after about a week or two of adding friends. This account is still connected to my email.

**Password:** I believe I remember my password but cannot be certain. I also believe I changed my password when I first encountered this problem but cannot be certain as after I submitted my first password change, Facebook just sent me to the login page without confirmation.

This message appeared when I tried to log in to my account the first time and it has appeared since on every of my subsequent logins:

Trying to find my account using this [link](https://facebook.com/login/identify) returns no results.

After having a friend recover my account, Facebook sent me an email to change my password (which means my email is still connected to the account) but when I tried to change my password (this being the second time), it showed the can't-use-this-feature message.

I don't think my account is disabled as when I tried to submit a review for disabled accounts, it says so. However, I cannot log in to confirm that my account is not disabled.

How I got back my hacked account : success story (after many days of trying almost everything possible!),"Hey!

I woke up a few days ago and I saw in my emails that someone changed the password of my Facebook account (and the hacker turned on the two factor authentication). Here's a little part of my previous post to put you in context:  
""I tried many things, like ""I forgot my password"" and went to the Facebook help pages. At first the hacker removed my e-mail from the account so it didn't work with ""I forgot my password"" so long story short I used the function that I had to send Facebook a picture of my ID so they can send my a link to reset my password. So I received the link pretty quickly yesterday morning, but when I click on it, it says ""*You* have *tried entering too many codes*. *Try* again later"".I tried a few times yesterday and today and it still says that. What should I do next? I really want my account back :/ at first I thought I would wait until the ""*You* have *tried entering too many codes""* would not show up but I don't know when it will happen.""

Since that post, I've been able to change my password after waiting a few days until it didn't say that I tried too many codes. I still wasn't able to access to my account because of the two factor authentication, but I was able to find the solution here on [r/facebook](https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/). You have to go on your computer (not your phone) and try to log in your Facebook account. And when it says that it sent a code to the authentication app, you have to click on something at the bottom of the page, I don't remember the exact words but it is something like ""You didn't receive your code?"" or something similar. From there, you can explain your problem to Facebook. You also have to join a picture of your ID. For me it was really quick, it took less than 12 hours to get an answer.

So right now I have a new password and I enabled the two factor authentication for myself, so it will be more secure for the future.

Don't hesitate to ask me any questions if you need help, because I'm really grateful since that subreddit has helped me to have my facebook account back.",facebook

I went to Facebook support on my PC to see if there is anything I can try... all pages point me to the same page about recovering a hacked account and ask me to visit a page and report my account as compromised. This sends me down a repeating loop that asks me to:

* enter my current or old pw (current pw has obviously been changed)
* next page tells me that my pw was changed ""X hours ago"" and ""If you don't know the current password on your account, you need to reset your password to continue. ""
* Selecting ""secure my account"" sends me to a page asking me ""how I want to reset my password"", but the only option is to send a code to the listed email address, which is not mine.
* The only other thing I can do is say ""I no longer have access to this""  which gives me 2 options... I can enter my old password and the entire process repeats itself, or I say again that ""I cannot access my email"" to which the response is *""Unfortunately, we're not able to give you access to the Facebook account you're trying to log into. This is because we can't confirm that it belongs to you. We may hide the information on your Facebook account if we detect that you cannot regain access to it.""*

It wants me to get a code from the code generator, but how am I supposed to do that without access to Facebook. I've tried having it send a code to my phone, but it never comes. I've also tried to just reset my password again but the person who got in apparently changed the contact email.

Now there is a spot the says if you're having trouble submit a request, which I have now done 5 times but no one responds to me. Does anyone know a quick way to get in touch with someone at Facebook.",facebook

I am aware that this is a violation of the requirement that you use ""the legal name you go by"" yaddda yaddaaa, but it seems like you could make a special case for this? Or at least get a Review. Add to that, I can find people with all sorts of crazy names that you know are not real, people that use pen names, performance names (lots of drag queens as an example) and so forth that are not getting perma-banned.

I messaged one person about a car they had for sale ( the Same One I own, I needed it for parts). I sent them pictures of my car(s) showing I was a serious buyer. We were actively chatting and setting up a time for me to drive MULTIPLE states away to come look at and get the car, and I was locked out and banned. I lucked out because the person that purchased this car resold it a few weeks later after the ""new turbo"" in it blew up... But I'd Still like my account back.  


I had appealed the ban with a photo ID. I never heard back, I was never Notified why I was banned. Its been a year or so with no resolution.

I've searched trying to find a real person : found numbers but they ring forever or just hang up after the 6th ring. Ive tried finding the old ""live chat"" business support but I cannot seem to find that either.

I tried to make a new account with the same email, phone number, and name as it appears on my ID AND as it appeared when created last year on facebook. But my email is banned apparently.

I hardly posted content other than a picture of half my face or so looking back at the car, my fiance. I did not repost garbage, make political, racial, ethnic, religious commentary, I did not post inappropriate photos, or anything that could be in violation of any community content. I literally used it only to message people about items I wanted to buy.

**I tried the email and photo ID and note resolution path.**

**I tried** [**https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/571927962827151**](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/571927962827151) **, but clicking send never seems to actually do anything, like its a dead link designed to waste ones time.**

**I tried the numbers people post on face books own help pages ( which I do suspect are fake).**

&amp;#x200B;

The reason for this now? A commercial light truck from another country is for sale in my area and only the second Ive seen in the USA in about 15 years, and I really want to reach out to the person. They talked to me in a automotive paint store a few years ago, but we never exchanged information. All I got to go on is his first name, but the truck is listed now on Marketplace and id love to call.",facebook

My Account has been compromised and I’m trying to regain access but they changed the phone number so I don’t receive the verification code when signing in. Can somebody please help?,"So about 2 days ago I had received some emails that my Facebook account had been logged into, and that someone managed to change the password. I didn’t see these until today when I tried to login to Facebook and it wouldn’t let me. 

I went through some sort of process to regain control of my account, and noticed they also switched the email and phone number, which allowed me to replace that email with a different email of mine. I was also able to change the password. I saved the email that they had used in case in might be useful.

Now when I try to login, it tries to put me through the 2 step verification process which would send a code through sms I believe. I’m not able to find which number they now have on there, therefore I’m not able to receive this code to login. 

I had also received an email mentioning that my Facebook account had been suspended from certain features, I’m hoping this is facebook catching some sort of malicious activity. My girlfriend tried to click on my account from her device and nothing happens when she clicks to view my profile. Also when she views the messages I sent her through the messenger app, it shows all my sent messages from the past like year as not available.

I’ve been logged out of my account on all devices and from I’ve researched Facebook doesn’t have a direct contact email or number so I figured maybe I would try my luck here. 

If anyone knows any additional steps I can take to recover my account, or at least permanently delete it or something so I can start anew, I would greatly appreciate any and all help.

Many Thanks!",facebook

Hi all! Long story short, I deleted my Facebook account in early December for personal reasons (I was super bummed out with friends and politics).

Facebook keeps telling to input my real name (I am, and it's fairly common).

Is there any direct way to report the scam ads that are seemingly running rampant on Facebook?,"I'm going to preface by saying that while I now realize this looks like I am ranting, I am truly asking for help because I am beyond frustrated at this point.

Let me explain. Beginning in November, I started seeing more and more fake/scam ads (cars,boats,rvs,atvs,etc) on the platform. I would use the automated reporting system, but it soon became apparent that it was a waste of my time, as I would always get a reply back ([https://i.imgur.com/t35Px5O.png](https://i.imgur.com/t35Px5O.png)) that said the post ""Doesn't go against any one of our community standards"". Community standard #5 ([https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/violence\_criminal\_behavior](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/violence_criminal_behavior)) states ""Fraud and Deception: In an effort to prevent fraudulent activity that can harm people or businesses, we remove content that purposefully deceives, willfully misrepresents or otherwise defrauds or exploits others for money or property. This includes content that seeks to coordinate or promote these activities using our services. We allow people to raise awareness and educate others as well as condemn these activities.""

That's it. I can send it back for a review, but the reply back is basically the Same.Exact.Thing

It's to the point where if it's a hacked account, and I'm able to find a contact phone # via Google, I will text the actual account holder (because I can't send via Facebook messaging because the hacker will intercept) a screen shot of the ad, a link to the ad (because the hacker will hide the ad from the actual account holder's page and turn off notifications), ask them to change their password then delete the ad before anybody gets ripped off, and lastly to check their CC statements as these hackers almost always use the CC on file of the accounts they hack, sometimes up to 100's of $$. That usually works, but sometimes it doesn't. Case in point tonight. The imgur image I linked above is from this very ad that I reported earlier tonight. The ad is for a 2013 Ford Raptor SVT for $21k. The hacker has blocked my ability to reply to the ad stating that it's a scam to warn others, and I contacted the actual account holder with a phone # I found online, but there has been no response. My last resort was to report it to Facebook knowing that nothing would come of it, but it was my last resort. People are replying to this ad inquiring about more info, location, etc. and I feel helpless that I am unable to do anything to warn people from getting scammed. Btw, KBB values this pickup at nearly $50k retail. This is commonly what these hackers do. You send them an email, they will give you some sob story of why it's so cheap and they just want to get rid of it, and to pay with eBay gift cards. Then &lt;&lt;poof&gt;&gt; they disappear.

There are also the fake pages that are just created within the last day or two, some of them that say that are selling cosmetics for example, but then advertise a car in a fake/scam ad. But that's a whole other story on why these fake pages are allowed to be created so easily and then immediately are able to post scam ads.

One of the options given is for me to block these ads when I see them. But then I feel I would be equally complicit as Facebook is. Besides that, a whole new round of hacked/fake pages would start fresh the very next day and it would just be an endless cycle of me blocking random people, all the while knowing people are getting scammed out of thousands of $$. 

For being a big-tech company, Facebook sure fails in common sense. 

I would like to add that while many companies fail miserably to remove these ads/fake pages when reported, there is one company that is extremely pro-active when I report these ads. Weebly. I can send them a link to a fake page, and it's almost always taken down within minutes. 

So my question is this. Is there any way to talk to an actual human, whether it be thru email or online chat, so I can explain what it is they are looking at when I report these? Because the automated reporting system is absolute trash, and IMO, Facebook is being completely complicit with these ads by not removing them when they are being straight-up told they are scams beforehand.",facebook

My new Facebook account has been disabled because I have some inactive accounts. Is there anything I can do?,"Hi,

A few days ago I've created an account and wasn't able to log in without confirming my phone number on the next day. After I've confirmed my phone number, they immediately let me back into my account. One or two days after that they've asked me for a selfie and I've uploaded it for review. Sadly this time the account got disabled a few days later.

&gt;**Your Account Has Been Disabled**  
You can't use Facebook because your account, or activity on it, didn't follow our Community Standards.  
We have already reviewed this decision and it can't be reversed.

All I did so far was adjusting settings and creating two pages, so it must be because of my other accounts that I've created at a young age and I don't have access to anymore. I never behaved bad on the platform, in fact, all I did back then was playing The Sims Social. Since I'm an EU citizen, I've contacted their DPO today and attached my passport, with the request to delete any accounts that led to the deactivation.

Anything else I could do? Is there a chance that I'll get my account back, eventhough the message states it can't be reversed?

Thanks in advance!",facebook
Facebook account got disabled upon creation,[removed],facebook
Facebook account got disabled upon creation. I tried going through the appeal process but that's pointless because there's nothing to reference phone number/picture of me to. Hope the titles is long enough to not get deleted again ...,"(Pls have mercy automod)

So  I used to have a facebook account up until 2/3 years ago when I got it  deleted because I wasn't using it anymore. Now I wanted to get in touch  with friends from high school, tried to create an account with a legit  email and my actual name obviously. I hit sign up and am greeted with a  message that my account got disabled. I tried to do the appeal process,  gave them a phone number and a photo etc. which was weird because they  obv got nothing for reference. No luck obv, another message saying the  decision is final and I violated they terms of service. I tried another  browser and an older email adress aswell as my google adress, same  result.

I can imagine that because  I had an account once it somehow interferes with that, but even when I  choose another name (like a short version of my first name) I get just  an ""error creating account"". But then again, it was supposed to be  DELETED soo ...

This wouldn't be  an issue if there was a way to contact support but for some reason the  like 2nd biggest company in the world doesn't have that? Only a help  website with random question that don't apply to me.

Anyone have similar experiences? I'm about to lose my mind, guess they don't need my juicy data.

My facebook has been hacked and I think it used whats app to verify my security code,"Hi all,

Just looking to see if anyone has heard of this type of hack before. My facebook account got hacked and my email and phone number has changed. I already went through the hoops of trying to recover my account via ID so hope on that will be done soon.

So last night at 1:30 am I was sleeping, but got a security code sent to whats app says from facebook security team.

I wake up to find out I cannot login to facebook and my email/phone number was changed. How did this hacker get the security code on whats app?

I have some thoughts to this as I do use whats app on my desktop too. Could they have remote desktop in to view my whats app? Could there be a breach in whats app?

Does anyone know on facebook if you need to change your phone number/email it would prompt to verify a code on your phone and email respectively? Would I not have been notified via email or txt that my recovery items have been changed? I didn't receive any.

The guide further said to switch to the classic design and to log out and back in to fix the issue for good. Now i did just that but the issue still prevails and many posts were deleted after the switch to classic mode. How can i switch back to the new mode, i see no such option.

And there is another option. When he logs in into the account an account shows up which only has 165 followers. When you click on the home page icon and on short cuts only there is the ""real"" account with 21k followers. How can he access this site directly?

My (ultimately resolved) experience with having my account hacked and the hacker enabling 2FA,"Posting this in case anyone happens to be in a similar situation and can use some help or encouragement. Based on the posts I've seen on this thread and others, this seems to be a reasonably common problem. TAKE STEPS NOW TO SECURE YOUR ACCOUNT! It may be a pain in the neck, but it's far easier to proactively secure your account than it is to deal with the stuff I went through.

My account (or, more accurately, one owned by a family member but I'll refer to it as mine for brevity) was hacked on approximately December 13th. Though the source of the hacking was unclear, my guess is that it was because 2FA was not enabled and the e-mail/password used for the account had been involved a different password breach.

The hacker immediately changed the recovery e-mail on the account so I was not able to do a password reset. Eventually, I used [facebook.com/hacked](https://facebook.com/hacked) and was able to reset the e-mail and password by verifying comments that I had made on various posts recently.

Unfortunately, the hacker had also enabled 2FA on the account, so even after successfully resetting the e-mail and password associated with the account, I was still unable to log in. I had no other browsers logged in to issue an approval, I did not have a mobile number attached to the account, I had not set up trusted friends ... nothing.

Since I (really, the family member) do not having a driver's license, passport, or similar government issued ID, I attempted to submit alternative forms of ID (mail, medical documentation, etc.) to the ""having trouble"" that's available when you're unable to log in via 2FA. I did this primarily in the mobile app. Whenever I'd submit, it would simply take me to the Facebook Help page, and I really had no idea whether the submission was working.

After doing this a few times, I eventually received a message that there were too many submissions and that my account would be prevent from making more submissions for an unspecified period of time.

I even reached out to some friends I know that work at Facebook, but Facebook internal policies didn't allow my friends to help a family member that they did not know personally. If it had been my account they could have helped, but since the account belongs to a family member, there was nothing they could do.

Finally, I got a copy of my birth certificate, waited for the lockout to expire (I tried once every 48 hours until it didn't give me the message), and submitted the request via a PC Web browser (not mobile).

Within about 5 days after that final submission, Facebook replied with a link that I was able to use to log in without 2FA, then set up 2FA with my phone number, the 2FA app, and grab some recovery codes.

All told, I was without access to the account for about 30 days.

So here are some final tips:

* If you get that e-mail saying the recovery e-mail has been changed, ACT ON IT QUICKLY before the hacker can do any damage.
* If this happens to you, DO NOT CREATE A NEW ACCOUNT. Not only is this against Facebook's terms of service, but it'll confuse any support requests you put in. Your new account may be locked if you create it with the same name or e-mail address, and then you've now got two problems instead of one.
* Enable 2FA on your account.  Use an authenticator app if you can. Get recovery codes.
* Have a good government issued ID. If you don't drive, get a state ID. Keep your passport renewed. Don't have to call your parents to find your birth certificate.
* If you find yourself hacked and unable to receive a 2FA code but you were able to reset your password, use the help links when you're prompted for a 2FA code. Submit on PC and mobile, but don't spam it. You'll get rate-limited.
* When you submit, if the app or browser redirects you to the Facebook help page, that's a successful submission.
* There's no way to talk to a person or get a ticket opened. It's just how it is. It sucks.

Has the old online booking system been removed from the Facebook Messenger app? I used to be able to manually do it via the Pages manager app on my phone or via the website directly on my computer. Any help would be appreciated!,"Hello.

I run a local business and am using Facebook for some of my customers, in which. For the past 2 years I have been using their online appointment booking system which allowed me to easily book my customers through Facebook Messenger either by the Pages App on my phone or on the website from my computer.

Recently this feature was no longer working, and has now gone completely.

I've contacted Facebook about 4 times about it and after a seemingly waste of time of a chase through my settings, which hadn't changed since I made the page. Apparently it's all good. Even though the button is no longer there for me to make appointments for my customers.

I can book appointments via the calendar. Although, this isn't what I need. Especially since it won't go directly to the customers inbox!

I've searched Google using multiple search terms to find the answer, and they're all the same... ""Facebook appointments via calendar""

Kinda annoyed because as I say, I had been using it for the last few years and it's been extremely useful because it sends a reminder the day before so they know when I'm due to arrive.

Now I'm having to manually type everything to them, I may as well convert them to mobile Text like the rest of my customer base and ditch Facebook all together if this system has genuinely been removed.

Anyway, apologies for the Long winded post, I've spent hours now trying to find answers to no avail. Perhaps someone here could help me out?

The old booking system used to look like the following screen shot I've sent. The button to make these appointments used to be where the pound (£) symbol is now.

By the way, I know they can book them selves in... I'm looking to book them in myself since that's what I was doing before and I don't use third party online booking systems/calendars to sync up. It prevents double bookings that way. Plus I don't have enough customers via Facebook to justify the needs for it either.

I deactivated it for personal reasons and to take an extended break from Facebook. I think the way they handle it by leaving an inactive profile without a picture in people’s friends lists is incredibly flawed. 

If I deactivate my account I want it to be frozen. That is, I want it to be the exact same when I return to it. Not missing friends, likes (which was surprising), etc. 

The way Instagram handles this is much better, since a deactivated profile completely disappears from the platform until it’s reactivated. If the profile is reactivated, then it can’t be deactivated again for a week — which is also better since it prevents people from popping in and out. 

I get the temptation for people to remove inactive accounts, since I’ve also noticed a growing amount in my friends list and I had considered removing them without realizing those accounts may or may not return. But I figured there’s no harm in leaving them other than inactive profiles cluttering the list. 

Maybe Facebook does it this way so users return to the platform as soon as possible, since it essentially punishes users for having an account deactivated. But it still bothers me to no end that I probably won’t be able to figure out who unfriended me, since I value every connection I have on Facebook perhaps more than I should. That’s just part of the anxiety that comes from these platforms I suppose. It almost makes me want to delete my account altogether, but creating a new profile and adding back the 500+ friends I do have would be almost impossible.",facebook

Access to an account that isn't mine?,,facebook
Access to an account that isn't mine. Could someone have created an account using my email?,"So I've been receiving emails of Facebook notifications for a while now. I don't have a Facebook account under this specific email so I thought it was odd at first. I just ignored it as spam/phishing/etc and deleted them when i saw them.
Yes I suppose I could have created a filter to block Facebook related emails but regardless. 

I then started to notice the amount of notifications to build up, followed by friend recommendations for people I know and/or those in my contacts, most through WhatsApp.

This got me concerned, so today I decided to look into it more. I opened the first email regarding Facebook I saw, which looked fairly genuine. Probably not the best idea to open it possibly being sketchy but I was willing to take the risk. 

It seemed to auto forward? me to the Facebook Web app through Gmail and it turns out there is an account open under a name that isn't mine. It seems idle, with no friends, no posts and the same number of unread notifications that match the latest email. 

I don't know what's happened here or how it has either?
Is it possible I accidentally opened a Facebook account somehow? 
Could someone else have opened an account using my email? 
Should I log out of the account? Or even try to delete it? 
Could someone have or had access to my email in the past to do this? 

Any insight is appreciated.",facebook
Locked out of account due to two-factor authentication,[removed],facebook
Security question,[removed],facebook
I’ve recently been locked out of my account due to Two-Factor Authentication. I’m not receiving the codes to my phone. I’ve filled out all of the account recovery/ID confirmation forms and have not received a response from FB. Any guidance would be appreciated.,"If anyone could help me resolve this issue I’d be extremely grateful. I’ve made zero progress thus far:
So recently I had a phone number change, I changed it on FB and received confirmations that my old number was removed AND that my new number was added. I changed my password a few weeks ago and they sent a code to my current phone to confirm it was me changing my password which I DID receive. Well after the password change before I got fully logged in it prompted me to “log out of all devices” I clicked yes just to be safe. However, after I typed my new password in it asked for my two-factor authentication code, which was not being sent to my phone, email, or any my contact info linked with my account. I’ve tried many times over the past week– again and again I do not receive the code. But it still sends the code to my phone to change my password when prompted. 

I’ve sent in the account recovery form multiple times where you have I provided a drivers license as ID– no luck, not even as much as a response from FB support. Is there any other form/page/advice someone could point me toward that would help me make any progress here? 

Again, I’d appreciate any help at all even if it doesn’t entirely resolve the problem. I’m willing to try about anything. With that said, obviously I’m not giving out my user/password/any personal info. I don’t want an account I’m locked out of to become a hacked account I’m locked out of lol but thanks to everyone for taking the time to read through this.",facebook

"Sending videos through messenger, they freeze at the end and only play 1-30 seconds of the original video","For instance, I sent a 44 second video from my mobile app earlier, and it came through to the other person as a 37 second video. When I then checked it on desktop version, it played for 37 seconds as normal and then froze for the remaining 7 seconds before looping. In other cases I've sent videos and only 1 second has come through in the same way.

This has happened for months to be honest but I've kind of just ignored it and sent videos through other means, but it's starting to get annoying so I was just hoping someone might have a suggestion.

So far I've tried clearing my app cache and reinstalling messenger (neither of which resolved the issue), and I tried installing messenger lite (which didn't allow me to send a .mp4 at all). I'm aware that theoretically there is a 25 MB limit on files sent through messenger, but the person I was testing this with has sent files in excess of 100 MB through without issue, whereas I've attempted to send smaller files - 21 MB for example - to no avail.

I've run out of ideas to test in fixing it so I'm open to any suggestions. P.S. I'm on android 9",facebook

Help to recover lost account,[removed],facebook
My Facebook account has been temporarily disabled. The account in question has very important information that involves another lost account from a game. I need to recover it in order to get the game account back.,"Just to summarize quickly, I lost my account information in a certain game/app that I linked to the lost Facebook account in question (i.e. the only way I can get the account information of the game is to log in to this Facebook account and thus recover my information). The issue is that this Facebook account has been ""temporarily disabled."" I attempted to recover the account, in which they requested to give them some sort of ID. This would not have been a problem except for the issue that the Facebook account name does not match my name (it was supposed to be a throwaway account so I could store the information of the game account). I ended up giving them a picture of my driving license, only thing is that I am worried that I won't be able to recover my account again because of the names. Just to contextualize, the game account that I lost is worth $100+, and this is the ONLY way to recover my account (I contacted customer support of said game and they told me to get the login into the Facebook account and get the account back).

This being said, will they still give me back the account? If not, is there a way where I can contact customer support directly so I can give them some context about the situation? Thanks in advance.",facebook

Hi,

When I was 12 my friend started bullying me physically and mentally. She was also spreading rumours and had been really rude to my family. She blocked me from everything and i got really sick and was off school for a year while doctors were trying to figure out what was wrong with me, so I couldn't ask her what had happened.

I know it is really stupid but I made a fake profile pretending to know me to try and ask her what had happened. Being immature and really sick at the time, I don't think I was very nice. I dont think I would have said anything really mean, but I am really embarrassed that i would even do that.

I deleted my account after about a week but 10 years later, i am extremely distressed about it. I am so worried that somebody will find out that it was me. I can't stop thinking about it because I know the messages are still there.

I messaged myself on the account to cover myself if i got blamed. I have been reporting it to facebook but no action has been taken. I don't know how I can explain the situation to them to get the messaged removed as 'abuse or spam.' I am so ashamed of myself and i dont know how to move on.

Breaking: Facebook's January 6th New Blanket Ban,[removed],facebook
"Breaking: Facebook’s January 6th Blanket Ban Published by The Liberty Block on January 8, 2021 Facebook Blanket-Bans Potentially Millions of Users without Reason and with a New Type of Ban – Facebook Proves Hostile Business Environment Risk As of last night, potentially millions of users were banne","Full article in the link below. Mods deleted original post because its title wasn't ""descriptive"" and that ""you have 300 characters"" (original title was ""Breaking: Facebook's January 6th New Blanket Ban""). So I copy-and-pasted the content of the article to the title. 

At roughly 8:30 pm EST on January 6th, 2021, Facebook issued a new blanket ban on what could easily wind up being millions of accounts. We're getting non-stop reports of people who don't even use Facebook any more having their accounts effectively frozen, all with identical timestamps and identical 30-day bans. It appears to be purely and nakedly politically motivated, and it seems to affect wholly apolitical and unrelated business accounts on shared networks, indicating a network-level IP ban. If your account has been mysteriously suspended until February 5th, you aren't even close to alone, and the article below goes into finer detail as to the nature of the ban.

The variance in who was featured, the topics presented, and the date the posts were made varied much more widely than usual.

Almost entirely individuals talking about the most inane topics I've seen on their pages. Went in and out a few times but it has remained the same this evening.

Can't open nor extract .zip file containing Facebook profile data,,facebook
Haven't been able to open nor extract the .zip-file containing my personal Facebook profile data. Also can't find any recent online threads about this issue.,"This problem regards my second Facebook profile which I want to give up for deletion due to personal reasons. Therefore I requested to download certain archives so I can back-up the personal data that I still wish to keep.

Up until now, I haven't been able to open or extract **ANY** of the created .zip-files. I have been able to do this succesfully in the past, so I don't quite understand why this isn't working out right now? I'm assuming it's a bug from their side and I have already reported it. However, I don't exactly have the time or patience to await an answer from their side ...

Can anyone help me out? For the time being I've deactivated my profile.

**STEPS THAT I'VE GONE THROUGH SO FAR:**

1. I selected ""high media quality"" and ""HTML format"" when I requested to download my selection containing the various archives of my preference. *Please note that my requested files are already significantly smaller in size since I'm not in need of my Facebook pictures and videos.*
2. Facebook then made the compressed file (.zip) available for download.
3. I tried to open and extract this file with Windows Explorer/7-zip/WinRAR. These programs either stated that the archives are empty, that the archive isn't an archive or that the format is unknown and/or damaged.
4. After this I redownloaded the file, thinking something might have gone wrong while downloading it. \[This didn't do anything\]
5. Then I re-requested the creation of a new compressed file with the same selected archives. \[Didn't work either\]
6. I then thought that I might have selected too many archives all at once. Maybe it didn't work because my file was just too large. I then requested the creation of a .zip-file with just the archive of my friendlist. While attempting to open/extract this .zip-file the same errors kept appearing as they did with the above mentioned .zip-files.
7. A friend then asked me if I was able to open any other type of .zip that was on my computer. I coincidentally had someone's handbook in a compressed file which I was able to open and extract succesfully with any of the programs that I've used for my Facebook .zip. This was just to check whether any of my programs/apps were corrupted.
8. After some online research I tried fixing all these Facebook .zip-files with the repair tool in WinRAR. \[Nothing changed\]
9. I then used Yodot Zip Repair \[Zilch\]

What the hell am I supposed to do? I'm quite tech-savvy thus it can't be THIS hard to obtain my personal data ... Feeling pretty frustrated at this point, please help meeeee!

I gave my ID card details/photos and my name and let Facebook 2-3 days time to unlock my account again. Curiously, Facebook then completely deactivated my account instead.  Now I don't even have the opportunity to start a new check, because then a message window from Facebook pops up, telling me: 

**""Our decision to deactivate your account cannot be verified. Your Facebook account has been deactivated for violating our community standards. We have already reviewed this decision and will not be reversing it.""** 

I currently don't see any other way to win my account back than to start this cry for help and hope for your help. Facebook has neither a contact form nor a telephone hotline. Just an imprint email to which they don't reply. If someone has contact with Facebook, knows a solution or can somehow manage to reactivate my account including Instagram and make it usable, I would be infinitely grateful to you! 

I think it's a real shame that someone hacked my account, did some mischief (I don't even know what was done because I can't see anything) and the account was blocked. My verification with my ID got rejected by Facebook and all contact options are blocked. 

I don't know what to do other than let it go viral so that Facebook gets wind of it itself? I don't know what helps. I am asking you for help! Thank you for everyone who does something and helps! Thank you for your help!",facebook

Question regarding potential imposter,,facebook
Potential Facebook imposter account. Has anyone experienced this before?,"Hi, 
As weird as this may sound, I think people I went to high school with have an imposter who has friended a lot of people in our “group”. 
This guy about a month ago out of nowhere claimed to have graduated class of ‘92, joined the high school’s alum page and literally everyone started getting friend requests from him. 
I didn’t remember him so I didn’t add him but my wife got a request as well (who didn’t go to the same high school) which raised my suspicion about the guy.
I started asking around and everyone gave the same response of “I don’t remember him, but I saw he had so many mutual friends I recognized so I just added him”. 
I noticed with the current political climate, he is posting in the more conservative-type conversations really over-the-top stuff while concurrently in the more liberal ones, he’s following suit but with a real liberal opinion.
I made a couple of people aware that this whole thing is odd and some people have posted publicly to the guy, “hey, sorry but I don’t remember you, how do we know eachother?”, and he’s gone completely silent. 
Believe it or not this same thing happened a couple of years ago with a random girl posing as everyone’s friend but without the political slant, and was called out after a couple of months and disappeared.
Has anyone experienced this or heard of it? What could be the motive for something like this?

"Is it safe to use the ""Buy Now"" option of the Facebook marketplace?",[removed],facebook
Why is Facebook imposing the new page update on one of my pages but not on the others? I would like to avoid making this update as I am not convinced by its features.,"I will try to make this as clear as possible.

I  have a Facebook page and recently Facebook offered me to switch to the  new version of page, which is a suggestion I ignored since I'm not  really a fan of their page updates. However, since December 31st 2020, I  believe, this update is now imposed. I have to activate it if I want to  continue posting. What bothers me about this update is the fact that,  now people won't be able to see the pages like anymore and only the  followers, which I think is stupid.

I  know there's apparently a way to swith back to the classic version, but  before ""taking the risk"" I wanted to make a test with another one of my  pages I cared less about. However, it doesn't offer (impose) this  option to swith to the new version. Do you know if this depends on the  numbers of likes/followers? I have around 11 K likes on the page that  offers the update and around 1,5 K likes on the page I wanted to use for  a test. Does any of you who have pages recently swicth to the new  version? Is it a good or a bad thing?

"Facebook Usability: Videos, Background Play, Video Speed Controller, FB Messenger","Greetings all,

On Android, I'm looking for a way to

1) play Facebook videos in the Background (Background Play)

2) Be able to speed up the videos by 1.5x, 1.75x, 2.00x speed (Video Speed Controller)

3) Be able to use Facebook messenger within a browser or separate FB client app

I don't want to have the default Facebook app installed to my phone.

If anyone has any FOSS FB Client apps to recommend, do share!

&amp;#x200B;

Are there Chrome extensions or Firefox addons that can accomplish these two things?

1) Video Background Play addon for Firefox DOES work. Does anyone know a Chrome extension that does the same thing?

2) Video Speed Controller addon for Firefox can't be installed on my Android phone. Anyone know a way to install this? Or an alternative addon? As well as a Chrome extension? I used to be able to install the addon to my phone.

Is there a Facebook client app that can allow these things, such as Frost?

&amp;#x200B;

My discoveries:

FireFox - allows background play addon. Still searching for a way to speed up videos. Unable to install Video Speed Controller addon.

Brave Browser (Chromium) - allows background play by default, but doesn't allow installation of extensions which could allow speeding up the video.

Kiwi (Chromium) - allows extensions to be installed but I don't know of any chrome extensions that allow background play and speeding up videos. ALSO, allows messenger to be used inside the browser!

Yandex (Chromium) - allows extensions...

Frost FB client app - doesn't allow background play or speeding up videos. Allows FB Messenger within the app. Is Frost safe to have installed on the phone? Is the spyware removed?

Facebook app - don't want to use. Dangerous for privacy.",facebook

Facebook Enforcement Bots are consistently and inaccurately flagging posts even after human enforcement numerous times verified the bots got it wrong with false positives but the violations are stacking to warnings of disabling my account and page for their inaccuracies. (screenshots provided),"Within a month's time my Facebook account and page have been getting spammed with notifications saying they are at risk. It started some time in early December 2020 and now today I got another. First it was saying something about a warning on my account may eventually become disabled. Then 2 weeks later got a threat saying my account is at risk of becoming disabled. Not even a week later I had my ability to post limited severely in groups so that I can at best post in maybe one time and that is it for the entire day. Now I get notified today that a page I run, not frequently posting but still actively managed, is also a risk of becoming restricted or unpublished.

This has been a common problem within 2020 where bots were flagging posts as spam that I contested or no one ever got back to me as they weren't spam. I looked at my Violation list and it says 6, not sure if that is all that are currently against my account as it doesn't decipher which ones I contested and won that the bot was wrong and which are still in dispute. In total from September 2018 to January 2020 I had 9 violations. Almost all were spam claims that has since died down and no risks or warnings were given until December. Until then there was no problems. Then I had 2 more violations, one in October and one in December. Both were claimed for going against Community Standards on nudity or sexual activity, I contested both because the bot was clearly in the wrong and both times a human Facebook Enforcement manually reviewed and found both did not violate community standards and the bot was wrong.

I got numerous of these where they said they got this wrong but I'd be posting all day screenshots. And some don't have the original final message where they said at the end that they were in the wrong like October's where I posted a meme about ""The Hub"" getting cancelled by credit card processors. No inappropriate stuff was shown but just because the word was in the meme it was flagged by the bot but the human ruled the bot was wrong.

So I have proven these Facebook bots are clearly getting it wrong numerous times and now its gone from inaccurate community standard flagging to now threatening to disable my page and account permanently. Some screenshots of the FB automated messages I have received. I decided to ask around in some groups and other people are also claiming they have been getting these warnings too recently as well. I have submitted ticket to ""report a problem"" and ""give feedback"" but heard nothing back. Is Facebook enforcement aware of this issue and that bots are wrongfully sending out warnings and threats of closing peoples accounts and pages?

All the violations listed against my page and account are invalid.

My Page-Isn't misrepresenting it's identity or purpose-I am not using multiple Facebook account but it has options to assign page roles and there are other accounts assigned as editor and admin. That is a feature built-in by Facebook for pages. They have had this role for well over a year.-No new accounts were created or taking actions to avoid restrictions on posting etc-I am not making it difficult to know my content's origins or making content seem more popular than it is. Only recently this page as been getting a slight increase in popularity of like 20 more likes in a month than usual so its just more than likely gaining traction.

My Account-Isn't pretending to be another person, real or fake, it is me-I am not using more than 1 account. I just happen to have other accounts on my desktop and smartphone but they are family members accounts and have been for several years. That is allowed on Facebook.-I am not making comments and posts that mislead people

So clearly Facebook needs to find out what is going on with their bots as they are going overboard and becoming super flag friendly ever since like October it has become much worse and I have no idea what changed. It feels as though even after the bot is proven wrong with a false flag, the violation still holds a tally mark against you I feel because my account theoretically should be in good standing with all these false positives verified by FB enforcements own human team saying to bot got it wrong but it feels like the bot violations are over ruling on punishment. And I'm not the only one experiencing this and we aren't getting any word from Facebook letting us know the bots have gone trigger happy on post as of late and need to get reworked or toned down. Even 5 groups I was apart of all got permanently disabled in the last 2 months starting in October including Plasmaposting, Gruntposting, Bugposting, Shaxxposting, Sargon of Akkad discussion group. So clearly there is a problem with the bots that can be seen from both me and my page and in groups I have been apart of getting hit hard known stop since October. Sargon of Akkad discussion group was perma-disabled from the post I made in October that FB human enforcement determined they were in the wrong but the group still remains perma-zucced even though the post was verified to not have gone against Community Standards. Human enforcement is almost consistently siding with me that bots are getting it wrong, something needs to be done about this.

Is Facebook's development team aware of this issue and addressing it? Wil they publicly come out and let people know there is an issue going on with the bots?",facebook

"For those who advised about the Microwave I ordered through Facebook Marketplace, thanks. Here's the conclusion to this saga. Yes I was SCAMMED, but I didn't loose money (besides the money shipping back). Please take note and learn from my mistake! Advice on how to alert FB is still appreciated.","Moral: DON'T EVER PAY ANYONE YOU DON'T KNOW THROUGH MESSENGER!!!!!!! IT'S AS GOOD AS PAYING CASH.

I paid this lady twice. For a working microwave range. Once through FB Marketplace and once through PayPal. Both I consider to be safe forms of payment. She refunded both times claiming she wouldn't get the money in time. She pleaded, demanded, and begged me to send money through messenger. I told her I was no longer interested I was done. She's like but I already shipped it!

I have pages of communication from her on messenger. She tried 5+ times to get me to pay through messenger. She needed help for her kid and then her water was being turned off. I needed to send the money NOW! I refused. Said I would pay her when the microwave arrived (as she couldn't get interception to work) and I could confirm it wasn't a box of rocks. 

She sent me tons of messages. Making like I was a horrible person for not helping her when she's kept up her side. Claiming she was an honest person who wouldn't take my money for something she wasn't honest about. She was very convincing. I'm still not sure if she really is in such a bad situation. SMH.

I finally got the microwave. Bought a cord and had my dad connect it for me to test (the power cord was snipped to the base). It turns on and sounds horrible. There are burn marks inside. And it doesn't heat. 

If it sounds too good to be true it probably is. 

She begged me to send back and I am, on my own dime. And far better packaged. She didn't apologise and just wants the tracking number. Of course because when she sent it worked and was clean (no soot). SMH

If I would have payed I would have had no protection. Just a broken microwave. I'll be blocking after I send the tracking. Then I'll be figuring out how to contact FB to report her.",facebook

Facebook Messenger on android keeps sending me messages I already received,"So I've been facing this problem on my phone for a very long time and it's getting ridiculous. I use Facebook for some time on another device like my computer, I send texts back and forth and and everything is alright. But when later I turn the Wifi on or mobile data on my phone, I get bombarded with hundreds of notifications of Facebook Messenger messages that I have already seen and/or responded to, so I have to sit and wait for a few minutes for my phone to go through a ton of annoying notification pop-ups, sounds, and vibrations. So it's basically lightning up like a christmas tree. Again, I've already seen these messages, answered all of them, and had full conversations with other people and all.  It's basically notifying me again of every message that hasn't been received on my phone.  Not only that, but when I open the app and the messages are being received, I can the see the Messenger app receiving the messages in real time and, like it's syncing right at that moment, which makes me things even more that it's a Messenger app problem.

  
Here's what I HAVE ALREADY TRIE TO DO BUT DIDN'T WORK : 

* Turn off battery saver mode.
* Turn off app optimization.
* Turn off data saver.
* Synchronization is already turned on for everything all the time.
* Change the browser I use on my computer so that maybe there's a cache problem.
* Clear the data, the cache, and reinstalling both the Facebook and Messenger apps on my phone.
* Search the internet, for hours hoping to find a solution.

None of these seem to work. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy A50 running on Android 10. However when I  read the Messenger app on the play store, it seems like some other users are facing this problem. I also tried to test this out on an older Samsung phone but the problem is also present there. I also checked all the Facebook and Messenger settings that could interfere with this, but nothing worked. 

Please If you encountered this problem before, or you're suffering from it, tell me. If you post the solution to it, I don't have much to give you, but me and some other users will be forever grateful to you, so thanks in advance.",facebook

"Since when do things like ""fuck you"" are in the bullying and harassment on social media like Facebook?","I along with many out there, who are probably for freedom of speech and expression, noticed that simple insults like the simple phrase such as ""fuck you"" that you might throw out there on a simple post or comment section over Facebook noticed that is being taken up as harassment or bullying...and, in their views, have no room on that according to their so called community standards.

The punch line and irony here is, not that is only against people who find vulgar speech for example as part of natural language itself and natural freedom of expression and that needs to be respected like basic freedoms of speech itself, but aside that it can be very much abused out there by peers which leads to oversensitised overall aspect of the whole platform, and its so called standards.

Since when did this fiasco started to take place? Given the simple fact that there is always a tool for these types of things at the end of every user, meaning if someone gets offended by these words or similar things they may as well as use the ""block"" function.

This is straight forward outrageous and whoever was behind this idiotic practice may as well as contact a psychiatrist or probably needs to do a psychiatric check, as this only leads to far worst things down the line. Is this an effect of the so called overly offended generation? If it is, then this world is certainly doomed and we are all heading towards a nightmare.

Aside that, as the irony goes forward, is that this occurred over a topic regarding the pandemic and was pointing out the abuse and misinformation and misguiding of peers on the platform. Shortly, the words were directed at someone who was against information of Covid-19 and the individual was actively encouraging the abiding to the laws of the pandemic, when it got called out even with those words that were used and considered vulgar.

Bottom line is, who the heck is in the wrongs and bads here? A user calling a simple name someone using vulgar words for the idiocy he supports and emanates or the idiot who actively undermines a serious situation where lives are put to risk and even death can occur at its impulses?

I  getting sick and tired of these hypocritical practices on social media and I am just waiting honestly for them to pile up and for me to close every contact with the crap called Facebook and affiliates.

Like isnt that how the internet works, theres a 1.0 version of something shitty like dogpile, or ask jeeves and then a 2.0 next gen version takes over because the free market decided they wanted relevant information and not dog shit. 

Like we had myspace, and then we had facebook. Shouldnt there be at least a couple more iterations? A couple more generations? A couple more evolutions? And dont say instagram.",facebook

Hey, not sure if this is the right place to ask but; 

I almost 100% of the time, use Facebook || FB messenger on my iPhone 7, the software and the apps are up to date. 

My account got permanently banned (long story, not really my fault but there was nothing important on there so not fussed) but I do use it to keep in contact with friends and family during lockdown, so I made a new account with a separate email, and tried to log in on my phone, and was met with an ‘unexpected log in error’ 

However when I try the account on my computer it’s completely fine? I’ve reset settings, redownloaded it, researched to see if there’s a device ban (couldn’t find anything) so I was wondering if anyone could help resolve it? 

I realise this might be like an official Reddit for Facebook, and if it is a ban, I might get an IP ban for trying to circumvent it, but I really don’t care, I don’t use my laptop, so If I can’t access it on my phone I’m not going to use it anyway, so do what you must.

No one I can call, no forum where I can get answers, just nothing.   


I actually have two problems, but my most urgent one is being able to get to my messages on my business page. I was doing business as normal, when the page failed and told me to reload it. I reloaded it and then got the message ""Sorry something went wrong - We're working on getting this fixed as soon as we can.""

  
That was a month ago. I get notifications of the messages I am receiving, but I cannot access them - when I click on the notification (or the lightning bolt icon), it just gives me the ""Sorry, something went wrong...""  


I have tried contacting support. Now I do note that this is an option on the error message page, but when I clicl on that link, it says [www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com) refused to connect.  


So I have written support from the ""Help and Support"" option via my page. Three times. No response. I have also posted in the Help community - no response.   


I have googled this until my fingers bled. I have tried the obvious - restarting my browser, logging out and back in again. Nada. I am using the latest version of Chrome - but have tried different browsers and get this same message.

It lists every other page I have adminned on or created- but \*not\* my primary business one.    


I previously used the Pages app and loved it. But when I updated to Business Manager, I could not longer get to my Business Page (see above). So I am seriously stuck for receiving my messages and doing business. I  have several messages now from customers which I can't get to.

Seeing facebook ads targeted towards wallet thief. Should I be worried?," 

Is it possible that our FB accounts are somehow linked? At least through targeted ads.

My wallet was stolen about a year ago. The thief tried to buy $3000 worth of golf equipment but my bank flagged it as suspicious immediately and it didn't go through. What is interesting is that since then I have been getting golf ads on Social Media. Just today I started getting ads for ""Starting a Physical Therapy Business"", and clicking on ""Why am I seeing this ad?"" was very telling. Essentially I can paint a vague picture of this wallet thief from the way out in left field ads I'm getting. I should note that I am not interested in golf at all, and have never studied or even considered going into the PT field. I was targeted with the ad because

1. I am over 18
2. I live in the US
3. I recently viewed a video on said creators page

BUT I have never heard of the creator. I took a quick glance at the page's videos and none of them struck any interest. I don't think I would have watched any of those videos as they were almost entirely related to starting a Physical therapy business.",facebook

The author I was listening to said that even, for example, the number of exclamation marks are noted to read sentiment in the posts/comments. 

If this is the case it would be much more informative than the simplistic “if comment on post by X then add more posts by X to news feed” process.

Anyone else notice trolling via facebook pages that are going unremoved?,"I have noticed that people have been creating FB pages to troll, and when the pages are reported FB doesn't remove the pages. One of the worst I know of is a small newspaper that hasn't been getting trolled by a person with multiple pages with discriminatory names, day and night. The troll has gone as far as to use the names of regular commenters in his page names. I have reported all of them, multiple times and nothing has been done about it. The main way I believe the troll has avoided a ban is because they have been only reacting, not posting. So, when you look at the reactions to pretty much any article, or comment, there is a bunch of discriminate and racist language. 

Anyone else see these kind of things happening on FB?",facebook
Anyone notice unchecked trolling by Facebook Pages? Anything that can be done?,"Anyone notice people making use of Facebook pages to troll? And that reporting such pages is ineffective? I am currently living in South Korea, and there is an English language edition of a local newspaper that someone has been trolling with Facebook pages for months now. Reporting the pages does absolutely nothing. I think the person primarily avoids detection by using reactions, instead of making posts. But the page names themselves are discriminatory, and at times contains frequent commenters names. For example: https://i.imgur.com/SJ0r9Vb.png

Now before you think, maybe this person is actually responding to some blantaly racist users or posts, they are not. For example, this post triggered the same response from the troll: https://i.imgur.com/Lin6hCi.png

In fact, pretty much anyone who is not Asian will get this response, and if you're Asian and you don't make any Ethnically-nationalistic type posts, for example if you make a legitimate criticism of Korea, or something supportive of the USA, the troll will proceed to react to them with pages calling them a 'banana'. 

Personally, I am pretty sure it is someone with mental health issues, because they have a massive fixation on the Korea Times, and seem to think the CIA is some how involed in this all: https://i.imgur.com/1AEI0Kl.png

And, for reference, this the newspaper: https://www.koreatimes.co.kr, so no the troll is also not fighting against some evil imperialist paper, like the troll seems to believe. 

I doubt much can be done, but is it possible? And has anyone else seen these types of things happen elsewhere? It is rather frustrating, and I don't even think the paper is able to combat the issue themselves.",facebook

HELP! Facebook app won't stop suggesting group with illegal content!,[removed],facebook
Help! Facebook is forcing a suggested group onto my news feed that directly violates TOS," 

For the last 6 days, Facebook will not remove a disgusting suggested group from my page. The group is called something like ""M\*th Models"" (yes, that) and shows disgusting looking people posting pictures of themselves openly using and waving around paraphernalia. This has NOTHING to do with any activity I've ever had on Facebook. I literally post links to news articles and dumb jokes/songs I like.

I've closed and reopened my app. I've restarted my phone, deleted app data for Facebook, reinstalled the app, and hid the suggested groups post at least 5 times. I've gone to my groups page and none of the other groups suggested have anything to do with people using meth on Facebook. And still, this horrifying group suggestion is spammed onto my page.

I've now reported this group 15 or more times to Facebook for various reasons, from self-harm to  violence. Apparently, there's no ability to report a group for running openly illegal activities and have that taken seriously. I've now forwarded this group to my local law enforcement contact line because I have no idea how to get this group removed from my page permanently if Facebook won't do it.

Their terms of service say illegal activity is explicitly banned from the site when reported. Can a mod here, or some Facebook support person, do ANYTHING to prevent my mobile app from being permanently disfigured?",facebook

And how do we contact someone from support, because it seems nearly impossible.","hey! so my friend’s account got hacked the other day, and the hacker logged him out on every device, and then turned on 2FA, so he can’t log in, since he isn’t getting any code (i’m guessing the hacker gets them). we tried every possible way to get his account back, but all we ended up with every time was just a pssword change. and absourdly we can’t find any support service we could talk to.

is there a way to solve this, or should we just let it go? (he really wants his acc back bc of old pictures and stuff)

I had this problem where I couldn’t change my messenger account’s profile picture, so I tried to make a new Facebook account and tie it to the messenger account by using the same phone number.

Whenever I try and login to this account I just get the message “You can’t login to Facebook using this account due to the restrictions of the account type.” Is there anyway I could sign back on to this account or am I sol.

Why Does Facebook Allow Sexual Harassment? And What Is The Point Of Having An Option To Report Sexual Harassment If Facebook Never Acknowledges Sexual Harassment as Sexual Harassment?,"When you're involved in a conversation unrelated to sex and a stranger starts making comments about your sex life and instructing you to engage in particular sex acts, this is called sexual harassment.  I have reported the offending comment three tines and Facebook keeps telling me it's not sexual harassment, even though it very obviously IS.  This is not the first time this has happened to me.  It's very obvious that Facebook allows sexual harassment, so I'm curious as to why they bothered including a function to report it.",facebook
Market Place Dilemma- Please Advise!,[removed],facebook
Is this crazy lady scamming me on marketplace? I spent over a day and probably 50+ messages trying to work this out. I'm a nice person but don't want to be taken advantage of. I'm tired and stressed. TIA,"I just don't know what to do and trying to find help from Facebook has been just as frustrating. Any advice is welcome.

Short story: I bought a microwave from a lady on FB marketplace. Paid $160 through FB marketplace on Dec. 24th with shipping and tax. No replies this week. Then issues with mailing on the 30th. Then she says FB marketplace payment won't work for her. Then she says she spent her last $30 on shipping plus extra for box. And she refunds my money and ask me to pay via messenger. We'll I got advised from friend there would be no protection for delivery for messenger payments. So I refuse and offer if she'll try marketplace again back and forth. She finally sets up PayPal. I PAY AGAIN $155 she upped the price (the other without tax was less). She returns the money after back and forth. Because it will take too long to get money. I tell her to stop shipment. She can't. She said she'll take FB payment again. Or even half now half when I get package. There's also the fact that the shipping info she eventually sent shows it's in preshippment (carrier hasn't received) still from the 24th. I don't know if this is a scam. If she's actually this clueless (it does seem that way, she's been doing an aweful lot). But also she's tried lots of different things to try to get me to basically electronically send her cash for an item I haven't seen. I've spent a lot of time and stress on this, I'm tired. She's got a sad sob story and I'm a kind person but don't want to be taken advantage of.",facebook

"Facebook suddenly started ""Secure Your Account"" process as soon as i add my personal account into a business site, now the only option it offers me is via SMS, and it doesn't even send the SMS to me.","Long story short, i just bought an advertisement and i was adding my personal account to a business organization that i just created for my site. As soon as i did that, my account was logged out from all devices. When i try to log in, it says :  


&gt; **Secure your account**   
&gt;  
&gt;You started securing your account on **Wednesday, 30 December 2020 at 14:09**.  
&gt;  
&gt;To finish securing your account, please verify your identity and change your password. Your account will remain hidden until you complete this process.

It only offers to send SMS for my account, but it only sent to me during midnight of that day. I tried to log in again, but this time it doesn't even offer that option anymore, it just redirect me to a site where it says :

&gt; **Identity not confirmed**   
&gt;  
&gt; We currently can't verify your identity. Please try again later. 

The only options i got are either log out or read about their security program. It has been like this for a day now. My account can't no longer be found publicly. I have tried the following methods :

1. Log in from another device / different internet.
2. Click on forgot my password, asked 3 trusted friends to provide a code and reset my password, but as soon as i confirm my new password, it says that ""Invalid request"" and my password didn't get changed.

So i was wondering :

1. Is my account toasted and gone forever? Or is there anyway to save it?
2. I'm running an ad on it as well, and i don't know if it's gonna steal my money while my account is being locked like this?

Thanks in advance.",facebook
Why is Facebook allowed to bypass phone hardware permissions on Samsung Android phones?,"This is my 2nd Samsung Android, and I notice that I cannot delete the Facebook app, only disable it.

That's fine. I actually want to use facebook without video calls.

Help in recovering access to account lost due to an ignorant mistake.,"4-5 weeks ago, I went into the privacy and security settings on my Facebook app, and removed access to all devices, including my phone. I didn't have access to, or didn't remember 90% of the connected devices, so I thought, ""what the hell, I'll start fresh."" The problem is, I had the Microsoft authenticator app set up for two factor authentication, and I must've uninstalled and reinstalled it since the last time I had to authenticate my login on my app, because when Facebook wants to authenticate, it doesn't show in my authenticator app. I did the recover option where I confirmed my ID, photo of license and all, and have had no response. However, last time I tried to login it sent an SMS code to my phone number to reset my password, and then had the option to check log out or stay logged in to previous devices, either way I click the button on the bottom of the screen says ""log in."" I click ""log in"" and it pulls up the screen saying ""logging in,"" but then pops of the two-factor authentication notice. However, this time is says an SMS with a code will be sent to me, but I never receive a code. I can reset my password using my number or email, but when I login it tries to authenticate through an SMS, but I'm not receiving a code. Anything else I try by clicking on ""having trouble?"" just redirects me to the same page that asks for my photo ID again. I've been fighting this for a month now am at a loss. Anyone have any idea how to resolve this?",facebook

LA ESPADA Y LA PARED // LOS PRO O CONTRAS DEL AUTORRELLENADO DE ESPACIOS DE CONTRASEÑA.,"Buen dia, lectores agradezco su tiempo de poder leer estas lineas. Mi nombre es Eduardo Tellez. Y frecuentemente me pasan cosas un tanto extrañas. Como es este caso:

Tengo una cuenta de Facebook desde el año 2016. Durante este tiempo hasta el 2020 eh cambiado la contraseña quizas entre 2 a 3 veces. La ultima vez fue porque me llegaron unos mensajes diciendo que alguien estaba tratando de accesar a mi facebook, me parecio obviamente algo extraño, la cambie y como siempre mi Samsung pass, me dice ""Guardar contraseña"" Oh dios. Claro que si... La fatiga que me evito poniendola... Sin embargo al no tener la necesidad de estar ingresando la contraseña la OLVIDE. Cuando reviso la contraseña de mi Samsung pass: xxxxxxx la copio y pego al navegador en la pagina del Facebook y me lanza pass incorrecto. Es decir cuando me logeo con mi huella, y se rellenan los espacios de LOGIN. Entro perfectamente. Sin embargo cuando coloco manualmente los caracteres me sale que el logeo a sido incorrecto. Aclarando este punto tengo acceso a mi cuenta de Facebook. Sin embargo no puedo accesar desde otro dispositivo que no sea mi celular.

**Recuperacion:**  
Facebook en todo su esplendor le falta un servicio de atención al cliente. Si hablamos de recuperar mi contraseña con alguien de servicio al cliente es como decir que el propio Mark me respondera.

Cuando intento recuperar mi facebook me salen las opciones que todos aca conocemos:  
**Correo o Numero de telefono. Oh vaya sorpresa! El numero de telefono que tenia con esa cuenta ya fue desactivado debido al poco uso que le daba**. Por lo que la opcion del celular queda descartada. 

Si hablamos de correo electrónico no tenia enlazado ningún correo electrónico por lo que igual estaria descartado.  


Cuando por fin tengo la ocpion de recuperacion mediante un ""correo"" Tengo mas de 4 meses esperandolo.

&amp;#x200B;

**Problemas dificiles requieren medidas estrictas.**

**Estoy aprendiendo a usar Phishing PARA AUTO ""HACKEARME"" sin embargo tendría que rellenar el login manualmente cosa, que obviamente me tira error.** 

Para finalizar les deseo un año nuevo.. Busco respuestas claro, pero tambien puedes echarte unas risas con esta historia. Ni una cosa ni la otra... Estoy bien jodido...

Hello there fellas

My mother had a problem with her Facebook account (one of them) earlier today. She's not very computer or phone savvy, and I'll be quoting what she said has happened, as well what I did and observed as a result of the problem.

So she said that she was browsing the Facebook Marketplace trough a Facebook Lite app on her phone. At some point she gets ''an error message''. At this time she still has her mobile data on and the home's wi-fi on. Since she doesn't understand much, she assumes both being on causes a problem. She turns off the mobile data leaving her only connected to the wi-fi. A loading circle appears on her phone and a bit after that it supposedly says, and I'm quoting (well the quote might not be exact, since I'm translating from another language. What exactly would be the message if her phone and apps were in English, I don't know) ""Error fixed. Do you want to exit?"". And she clicks exit. After that point her profile appears to no longer exists.  
She tried the forgotten password option, but then it says that the filled information is not connected with any Facebook account. I open Messenger on my phone to try to write her , her profile is still in my list of contacts but the message cannot be delivered. It says ""One or more of your recipients are not valid. Please try again."" I also opened Facebook through my PC, she no longer exists in my friend list, and her profile cannot be found.

Anyone has any idea what's going on?",facebook

"My Proposed Rules of Etiquette For Buyers &amp; Sellers on Marketplace--Descriptions, Prompt Responses","In the past 2-odd years Facebook has all but replaced Craigslist as the place for second-hand shopping--at least in my area. Compared to FB Marketplace, Craigslist is practically a ghost town. I do quite a bit of buying-selling there, and here are my personal guidelines for etiquette. I will put in each one whether this is a rule for a seller (me being a buyer) or a buyer (me being a seller).

(1) Seller. BE SPECIFIC about the product and include an ample description. This goes especially with computers, there's big difference in a machine that's only 2-3 years old and one that's 8-10 years old. RAM, the CPU being used, hard drive space, whether it has USB 2 or 3, all of those are important. If you don't understand those terms, then have the model number ready so I can look it up and find out for myself.

I'm using an old computer with 4G of RAM and don't want anything with less than 8G or even 16G, I also don't want anything older than Windows 8 preferably 10.

In like manner, if it's a car I need to know if it has a 4 or V6 engine (unless it's a Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla where you know it's a 4). 5-speed or auto, regular auto or CVT (especially with Nissans, as those are notoriously prone to failure), INCLUDE this information in your ad from the get-go.

(2) Buyer. Speaking of #1, I'm fine with most questions, but read the ad. ""Is it a standard?"" It says in the ad AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION. Read the darned thing.

(3) Seller. No holds. OK I get it, no holds, but if I'm on the way, I'm on the way. DO NOT sell to someone else who gets there first if I am in fact on the way &amp; have told you this and given ETA. I understand not waiting around all day and prioritizing who gets there first, but once I've said ""I'm on the way,"" you WAIT and give me a chance. Once I've pulled out of the driveway and am on route &amp; you know this along with an ETA, you have no business selling to someone else.

(4) Buyer. In the spirit of #3 I will not sell out from under you if you're on the way, but I also have the right to sell to someone else who inquired after you if it's easier on me. If they can get here quicker vs in several days, if they can pay the way I prefer, I reserve the right to sell to them rather than having to sell to you first because you contacted me first.

(5) Seller. This is the big one. Stop taking all freaking day long to answer an inquiry. This is ridiculous. We're not in the paper checks and micro-cassette answering machine era. Unless your mother is in the hospital for a heart attack and your phone died unexpectedly, there is no reason for it to take all freaking day long to hear anything back. Like Seinfeld said when complaining about someone not calling back ""maybe they're out of town"" he said ""they don't have phones out of town?"" That was the standard then, that's the standard even more now that we have cell phones. That is my expectation, and I'm sticking with it.

No you don't ""have a life and am not glued to my phone,"" because when I send a message ""you're never selling a product by taking until the end of the Ice Age to reply to someone"" or post to the ad itself ""apparently it's sold and the seller is just rudely ignoring all of our inquiries"" then all of a sudden you're not so busy anymore.

We get it, you work, you're in school, you're ""busy"" organizing your collection of Teena Marie action figure Styrofoam plates--whatever. Taking an hour or even a couple, ok--all day, nonsense. You posted an item for sale, an act that is ASKING PEOPLE TO CONTACT YOU and then acting all aghast and annoyed when they do because you're apparently some backwards-antisocial introvert who doesn't wish to be disturbed. Onions. You want to sell something, reply to people, or don't sell anything at all until you can.",facebook

Facebook stuck on offline mode - Support doesn't reply back to me.,[removed],facebook
I've been having issues with the Facebook stuck on offline mode. Support doesn't answer me at all.," I needed to go offline for a couple of days, so I remember setting the chat to appear offline in 3 different areas. The browser and mobile versions of facebook, along with messenger app. When I tried to go online again I switched everything back but but for some reason I was stuck in the offline state. I appear offline to everybody and nobody appears online to me now as if I never went back online. I have sent support tickets 4 times over the last month and nobody is answering back. I have tried switching it off and on multiple times, tried different settings etc and I am running dry out of ideas. Being involuntarily stuck like that is a terrible experience. Normally I would have deleted my profile and made a new one but I have it since 2009 and I don't want to let go just yet. Any help would be appreciated, thanks.",facebook

It’s gotten out of hand now. I’ve just been banned for 24 hours because I was having a bit of lighthearted banter with a chap and he called me “pond life” and so I called him an “obnoxious toad”.

A tame little insult like that between two grown men and Facebook makes the decision that I was too nasty to him and had to molly-coddle him.

I’m a skeptic and non-believer but, out of sheer curiosity and for fun, I want to have a psychic I saw advertised on Facebook do a drawing for me. Never contacted a psychic before but always wanted to do so.

Unfortunately, there is no safer option like PayPal — only a credit card is accepted. I don’t know if this is in itself a warning to stay away. There are so many comments on her page that I figure at least some might be actual customers...well, I hope so, anyway.
Part of me says that Facebook would not openly allow someone to scam people like this if that is what she’s doing. This is a public page all can see, not some person you have to friend request or whatever.

Creator Studio error message when trying to post to Instagram - always worked before,"I have been using Creator Studio for about six months now with no issues scheduling and posting to both Facebook and Instagram business accounts.

The other day, our IG account was locked, I'm guessing due to someone trying to log in with incorrect password, so they forced us to change the password.  All went smoothly as far as I could tell, so I continued to schedule our holiday break posts through Creator Studio.

Fast forward to Christmas morning and I realized our post didn't go up on IG, and then I realized the scheduled post from the day before had not gone up either.

I have no trouble posting directly from my phone but all scheduled posts to IG through Creator Studio give me an error message saying the post couldn't be posted or edited.

I tried disconnecting and reconnecting the IG account from Creator Studio - which turned all of my scheduled posts into drafts, the least of my problems if it worked - but it didn't work.  It's reconnected and appeared to log in fine but I still get the same error message even if turning the drafts into new posts and scheduling them and waiting for them to post.  They don't.

She told me the first time she got the call from me she answered and it just kept loading, it would never connect, which is similar to what my other friend had said when it happened in the past.

Transferring page ownership and deleting a Facebook Profile is more difficult than expected,"&gt;Posted here as well

https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/kkq6ks/deleting_facebook_and_transferring_page_ownership/

As many have decided at one point or another, I am permanently deleting my personal Facebook profile. I've had it for almost 15 years now, and frankly no good has come of it. Or, it's an overall net negative.

Only current things I need it for are:

1. Oculus VR account
2. Managed Business Pages and Groups

So, here is what I figured. I'll create a separate account with a different email address that has no content or connections to anyone else, and I'll change my admin ownership of any pages/groups to the new account.

Did that without too much issue. I was able to access all my pages from the new account.

Oculus account will be trickier. Doesn't look like they give you a way to transfer ownership. So, I will simply delete my existing Oculus account and create a new one linked to the new Facebook account.

Thankfully, all my VR Games are on SteamVR and I didn't use Oculus account for any purchases.

So, I delete my Oculus data and mark the account for deletion.

Deleting or Deactivating my Facebook Profile seems to be an issue. I'm currently getting [this](https://i.imgur.com/RJ0awGd.png) message.

Now, when I try to sign back into my new Facebook account and I get [this](https://i.imgur.com/dXgschL.png). I guess it was flagged as a potentially malicious account? Hopefully they don't give me a hard time about it.

Anyway, so that's where I'm at right now. I still need some FB access so I can continue to manage my business pages, but personal profile can be deleted.

It's almost like Facebook doesn't want to lose people posting. this is harder than it should be.

And I'm realizing now more than ever how much of an issue it is for Facebook to have their hands in so many pots. This will affect Messenger, Oculus, Whatsapp and probably my Instagram as well.",facebook

When setting up hardware keys for 2FA I am (unexpectedly) asked for a PIN.

I recall that the only other time I was asked similarly was when setting up these same yubikeys for 1Password a year ago. I did use a PIN as a one off as I was never requested to do so again.

Is it for sure that the PIN being requested for the establishment of these keys for FB is the same PIN I was requested to set up when first 'doing' 1Password?

My wife got me an Oculus for Christmas, which I am very excited about, though I have now learned that you need to have a Facebook account in order to use it, which I am much less excited about. I actually deleted my Facebook account earlier in 2020, after having barely used it for years (unfortunate timing I suppose). Now I have tried to create a new account with my same email address, as well as two other attempts with new email addresses, and each one was immediately disabled upon creation for not following the 'Community Standards'. My prior account did not have any issues or flags when I deleted it. Is this just a Facebook grudge for me previously deleting my account?

Facebook account hacked. Need help getting it back. Never experienced a more inept &amp; backwards 'support',"30\[m\] in US. Need help with regaining access to my facebook account. Thank you in advance.

Apparently, looking this up its not that uncommon but I woke up to a text for a facebook security code. Tried to access my account from my phone. Everything changed. Logged onto my computer. Changed.

Tried the 'forgot password' thing but it's now linking to a new email. Tried 'another way' which then links to a new phone number. Back and forth, back and forth. Whoever designed this 'verification method' is a real idiot.

I logged onto my original email and lo and behold I had both, ""You've changed the email of your account"" &amp; ""You've changed the password of your account"". I've followed these through and was able to put my original email, &amp; of course changed the password to that too (I considered completely changing the attached email but decided to keep the same email, just in case, I didn't want to put another email on the hacker's radar).

I was shown through my more recent activity (friend requests, comments, posts, etc) to verify my things and delete things that weren't.. All good except the hacker's email was still attached. Ok, I'll just completely remove it once I log in.

PROGRESS!

Until now the 2 step verification page. Which can be accessed on my facebook account on my mobile........

But although I was able to put in my correct email and password, I was THEN sent a verification to the updated (read: hacker's) phone number.... and now back to square one.

Hate to admit but my brother's account got hacked a few months ago and he didn't even have the original email so he just gave up after this nonsense back and forth and just made a new account. I don't think I care to make an entire new account at least not for a long while but I do use it for events and the messenger so this is really irritating.

Please help.

When clicking the button to add the info I'm greeted with an error ""an unexpected error occurred. please try again later"". When checking through Facebook it says I can request a review, I click it and it says I'm missing info to verify my identity and needs to send an email confirmation code. I never receive the code even after trying multiple emails and checking spam. It's been like this for about a day. Any info on this problem? Thanks!",facebook

How do you submit a GDPR data deletion request to Facebook for an account that you no longer have access to?,"Hi,

Long story short, I created a Facebook account years ago when it first became a popular service and then disabled it. I later created another Facebook account which is my currently one that I use sparingly. Unfortunately, I forgot the password and email associated with the original account so I am unable to login, reactivate it, and then formally delete it. How would I go about submitting a GDPR request to delete the account without having access to it?

I am an EU citizen but do not currently live in the EU.

Facebook marketplace is a joke for sellers. Beware of refunds for no reason,"Hey everyone, just another angry seller post talking about how crappy facebooks ""refund/return"" policy is. I'm glad I'm selling most of my listings for under $10 each but if I was selling higher cost items this would be a nightmare.

So I'm looking through my payout history and calculating my profits when I see a string of refunds given to buyers. All four items were shipped and delivered to the buyer. And a couple cases there was no conversation between me and the buyer and they were just given a surprise refund with no notification to me. And a couple other situation there was a buyer message complaining about the shipping being slow and then they were given refunds

Facebook is implementing seller fees starting 2021 starting at 5%. Hopefully if we have to start paying seller fees to sell stuff on their platform they have a actually working platform that doesn't just give people free stuff just because they complain or some kind of support beside copy/paste and ban happy AI",facebook

Facebook puts down small businesses and entrepreneurs while helping the big corporations get bigger. Needs Regulation,"Hey everyone. Today I want to talk about Facebook's biggest fear , regulation. 

Facebook has become so big and became such a big part of many peoples lives That many businesses do their business on it. Many businesses actually rely on Facebook completely to run their business or for the vast majority of their business.

Facebook already nearly owns the advertising space along with google as well as many more issues including censorship.

"My friend's account got hacked, email and password changed (no alternate email or phone number), cannot recover account by verifying ID","My friend's account got hacked a couple of months ago and according to her, she tried to recover her account via the recovery email that was sent to her email initially but failed to do so. The hacker has since changed her email and password. So fast forward to two months later, she told me about it and see if I can help. She tried recovering via Facebook's recommendations/support guidelines and failed. I tried as well and realised how stupid the system is when you tried to report a hacked account. They direct you to recover your account via the hacker's email, asking you to log in to the account using the hacker's password or through the verification code that is sent to the hacker's email, which is impossible. She also doesn't have an alternate way (e.g. email address or mobile number) to recover her account.  She tried to send two different forms of IDs on two separate occasions (national ID and passport) and both replies she got were that they need to ""receive an accepted form of ID that matches the information listed on the account"". She is Chinese with a Chinese and English name together as her official name but she only used her English name as her Facebook displayed name. One of her IDs has her English name on it and the other doesn't. She has photos on both her IDs. At this point, we have exhausted all options and do not know how to recover her account.

“Login Error - An Unexpected Error Occurred. Please Try Logging In Again Later” EVEN AFTER FACTORY RESET,"FACEBOOK ISSUE:

This has been happening for two weeks now, and there’s numerous threads on the Facebook subreddit made by people who’ve been dealing with this for months. The only solution found so far has been to do a hard reset on the iPhone.

I Had to delete Facebook to make room for a stupid iOS update because there was a glitch where I had no free storage - post-update I had over 40GB free so I re-downloaded the apps I offloaded or deleted and they’re all working normally now with the exception of this Facebook glitch. It’s infuriating. I can still login on Chrome on the phone, and messenger but cannot onto the actual Facebook app.

EDIT: Ok, so I just did the reset because someone tried to hack into my account and I had to change my password which logged me out of messenger and then the login error began on messenger too which had been working fine until then.So I got home from work and did a complete factory reset of my iPhone. Upon the set-up process I selected backing-up from iCloud, but there are only two backups available to select. I used the oldest one which was only from 12/16. The other one was 12/20.This whole process played out and then when Facebook re-downloaded I attempted to relog into both it and messenger, and neither one is working still. Same error message.HOW DO I FIX THIS!?!?",facebook

"Facebook - ""We noticed unusual activity on your account and have restricted your access to advertising"". I only joined today (both personal account and business account). How do I speak to a person about this?","Hello,

A few hours ago I started a personal facebook account purely to be able to create a business account, which I also created directly afterwards. I have no idea what they mean by unusual activity so I would like to question them about it. Does anyone know how?

As far as I can tell there is an official appeal/ review however they are asking me for face ID so I can't proceed. I don't want to give them my picture. I have no picture on my personal account. I don't want to be the face of my business (i'm not a public sort of person) nor do I want anyone at Facebook (employees etc.) having any contact with my personal ID whether they delete it after 20 days or not. How do I get round this? Does everyone with a business account have to provide face ID?

Is it still worth having a business account (just as a landing page with links to my store) that does not have ad capabilities? Just wondering if I should delete everything or not.

Thanks,",facebook

Glitch - Picture I'm not Tagged in Still Shows up on my Profile,[removed],facebook
"I cannot remove a tagged photo from appearing on my profile under ""Tagged Photos"", even though I'm no longer tagged in the picture.","I cannot remove a tagged photo from appearing on my profile, even though I'm no longer tagged in the picture.

I truly believe this is a glitch, because the normal drop down options on the picture are not there for just this one picture (that would include ""remove from profile"". It's still showing up and there's no way for me to take it off my profile. It's just a bit embarrassing and juvenile (picture attached), but regardless, it shouldn't be in my tagged photos if I'm not tagged in it. There is a tag with free text of my name, but not an actual tag linked to my profile that I can remove (in the last picture, not capitalized, not able to be clicked on). Does anyone know how to fix this? I've tried to block and unblock this girl hoping it would reset it, but it continues to pop back onto my profile when I unblock her.

I'd like to avoid reaching out to a girl I haven't talked to since middle school about something like this, but it's just a little embarrassing to have on my profile. I'd also like to avoid blocking her since we have cute posts from back in the day. I've already filled out many ""reports"" on the picture, but to no avail.

"My uncle's account got hacked. Recieved no email or notifications- email address just suddenly changed. How can he take it back? (Advice needed, please help!)","Greetings from a college student in Hong Kong. As the title says, my uncle's Facebook account has been hacked. His account was created from 2008, so that's a lot of sensitive information- and the account is now posting some Vietnamese posts right now. I'm scared that my family's information (including his daughter, my 8 yr old cousin) will be leaked. So here's the scenario:
His account received a password reset on last May, out of the blue. He didn't do anything, but was unable to log back in ever since. He thought it was some faulty bug and created a new account.
Yesterday, the account came active, changed icon and started posting some Vietnamese posts (and tagging some other Vietnamese people. I'm really really scared if they would share his information to strangers). I check the account's email, and unsurprisingly, it was changed to an address nobody recognises.
Here's the catch: he did NOT receive any email changes in his original email. Facebook's Q and A said that if his email was changed, he should've recieved an e-mail which can reverse the process-and clearly that did not happen. He received nothing, not even recovery emails.
What's even more stupid is, when you look up Facebook's help manual, all there is is under the assumption that the email is still linked to the account, which. Is. NOT. In. This. Case.
What should he do to recover his account? Does anyone with a similar experience can share your aid? Thanks!!",facebook

I had her buy NordVPN and use it on her new computer. New account with a new email address, banned within 5 minutes. Just in case, I had her get a new modem from her ISP and a new IP address. New email address, banned again within 5 minutes.

Facebook taking over 3 weeks to verify my ID. I have had a Quest 2 since black Friday that I haven't been able to use it.," I had not used my Facebook account for a couple of years until I tried to log in with my Quest 2. I had to do password recovery being I do not use Facebook and that somehow triggered ID verification. I sent ID (scan of Drivers License) on the 27th of November and waited. 8 days later I received an email saying,

""Thanks for submitting your ID. However, we can't confirm your identity until you provide an ID. ""

I sent the ID again not sure what the heck to do. A couple of days later I tried to log in and go through the ID submittal process again. This time it wouldn't let me upload the scan because it wasn't minimum 1600 x 1200 pixels. That would have been nice to know in the first place.

So I took a photo of my DL and submitted that.

Finally, yesterday, I received a lovely email stating the following:

""Hi,

We can’t give you access to this account or help with your request until we receive an accepted form of ID that matches the information listed on the account. Learn more about the types of ID we accept in the Help Center:

I had my wife use her account to verify my info was correct on Facebook and matching my ID.

I am at a complete loss. It is ridiculous that someone who simply had to change their password because they hadn't logged into their Facebook account has to wait for an unknown length of time to get access to their account to use a piece of Hardware!

I Received A Warning And a Temporary Ban for an Article I Never Posted. Somehow It's Auto-Posted Not Once But Twice.,"I saved an article posted by VICE (popular media outlet) and Facebook instantly gave me a warning for ""going against community standards"" and trying to post something I wasn't supposed to. Problem is, I only *saved* the article...I never tried to post it to start with. Okay, I accepted their decision because I had no other alternative. They warned me I'd get a temp ban if I did it again.

About 30 minutes later, I get kicked out of my account because of the same article! It auto-reposted by itself. HOW IS THIS HAPPENING?

During the same interval, FB told me a picture I'd posted yesterday was added ""45 minutes ago"" so I know it's something funky going on with the site. But if I get a 3-day block because of their screw up I'm gonna be pissed. What can I do, and how can I prevent this weird article from auto posting on my page after I go to bed or something? That would be even WORSE.  I decided to ""appeal the decision"" the second time just to see what would happen so I'm scared it will be approved and post to my page in the night.  As of now I can still access my account even though it said I was banned for 24 hours.  

Thanks in advance. This is downright creepy. I checked and the article is no longer saved to my 'Saved Articles' archive thing, if it ever was. I'm on a Chromebook if it matters. There's no way I accidentally shared this article as the 'share' and 'save' buttons aren't anywhere near each other and the second time I wasn't even trying to save it...

Messenger deleted months of conversations. Can we get the messages back?,"Apart from what other have already reported about all our shared photos and vids getting deleted, not being able to edit photos before sending in a chat, and not being able to use nicknames,

I have noticed that it has deleted part of my messages!!! I was scrolling up a conversation to find something and it suddenly jumped to September 12th, and only showed my half of yesterday's conversation with my friend.

It's a person we talk daily, so that's a lot of messages gone!!!

"Did Facebook just recently make the ""delete your own post"" unavailable?","It's always been an option, but now there is a ""recycle bin"" for posts that stay there for 30 days. What's the purpose of this?

EDIT: Have read the rules and this rule, I believe, is still OK. This is just a discussion of a feature.

&gt;No posts noting how much Facebook sucks/Facebok rants. These are not ""support"" questions, and when you come into modmail asking ""why was I banned?"" when you posted, ""Facebook needs to be torn to the ground"", you are going to know why. There are still plenty of subs out there to post that sort of content, so we don't need that cluttered. Anytime you see a facebook related post make top page, you always see the same thing. ""Fuck Facebook"" and ""delete Facebook."" So stick to spamming the same tired rhetoric to those other subs (assuming their rules allow it).",facebook

Can anyone else no longer see when someone has read their message on messenger?,"I should specify that this is happening on a Samsung S10 for me. Today I suddenly lost the ability to see when someone has read my message in the main menu. Their picture that normally is on the right side when they've seen it (as well as the tick that appears if they had it) are just not there, and I have to actually open up my chat with them to see it which is just mildly inconvenient

I'm really getting tired of Messenger constantly removing functions with no apparent reason. Wasn't taking away games and polls and events enough?

FaceBook has gotten lazy with reporting fake accounts sending friend requests.,"I’ve been getting them a lot lately. It’s obviously a fake profile due to the profiles only having 2 photo’s, not the same gender as the photos in the profile, and the profile URL having a male name from either the Middle East or some African name.

Reporting it does absolutely nothing since they send back “We see nothing wrong with this post, if you feel it violates community standards block them”

Well it would help if it was a post or a photo, but it’s the whole damn account...

Yet for some reason I’m seeing friends getting post blocked for posts up to 4 years ago.

"Receive and check Facebook Pages messages on email without having to log in to Facebook directly, or at least receive email notifications of new messages"," Hi! I hope this is a good place to ask this question:

I don't like to get notifications on my phone of my Facebook pages, since I have many and my phone would be vibrating constantly and at all hours. So the only way right now for me to check if I have new messages is to go to the Facebook Page and see... but sometimes I forget to do so and take too long to respond.

So I was wondering if there's a way to receive the message that the user wrote on my pages on my email? and maybe even respond there? or at least, get notifications by email when a new message is sent to my pages.

I remember you could do that in the past but I can't find it right now.

Maybe there's a third party tool to administer the messages if that's not possible with Facebook itself. Thank you.",facebook

Whereas if I share this link from a web browser to messenger, it works on both sides.  What the heck?

the sharing debugger doesn't surface any issues, but now that I think about this, I have seen this issue for a while.

Before that, it was for a meme of some sort, don’t remember, but had no offensive content. I appeal and appeal and nothing happens. It all started because I accidentally posted a screenshot of a drawing my friend had done that was explicit when I meant to post a screenshot of a conversation. Ever since then, the tiniest things get me 30 day bans and they always cite “bullying and harassment.” I want to make an account that isn’t associated with mine but when I try it links it to my current account and when my main goes to jail so do my alts.

I sent my school id twice (first when i got logged out all of a sudden and can’t logged back in, and second after 24 hrs that i haven’t received any response) but after 2 days since i first sent an ID they sent me an email twice saying that they can’t give me access to my account because of the ID i sent so i sent a different ID which is my passport but after a few minutes i received an email again saying the same thing as the first ones. i did it 5 times already but i kept receiving the same email. it’s been 6 days and i don’t know what to do to access it. all of the contents of my account is unavailable and my friends said that my account is only labeled as “facebook user”. i really need to access my account, is there any other way?",facebook

I got my Facebook account back after being disabled for no reason with no warning. Here’s how. Here is also how to protect yourself from this happening to you and what to do if it does.,"‪A few days ago I posted on here about how my account was disabled for no reason out of nowhere, citing that I did not follow community standards. I own an ad agency and spend thousands with them each month. They not only jeopardized 13 years of my life in photos and connections, but also my livelihood. Here’s what I did:

First, I appealed the disablement with the form they provided. I submitted my info along with a pic of my DL for proof of identity. I was only able to do that once. It wouldn’t allow me to submit again. I then emailed accounts@support.Facebook.com 8 times with my DL for proof of identity, along with receipts of the thousands of dollars I spend per month. 

I also took to Twitter using #facebookdisabledme and sent several tweets/retweeted @facebook, calling them out. I suggest doing this as well, if anything to draw their attention to what’s happening to so many. 

After sending the receipts my account was up again within two days. ‬(The whole process of getting back on was about 4 days.) The only emails I got back from them were automated responses, so I am simply hypothesizing the idea that the receipts are what did it. However, they’d be fools to disable an account that pays them well over $12K per year, but who am I to say? 

Also, one of the posts I went off on them for on Twitter was the one that says “Small Businesses Are the Heart of What We Do” or some similar bs. Literally the biggest farce I’ve ever read, considering how many people are still waiting hopelessly to get their accounts back. Comment on that tweet if you choose to comment at all. 

After my account was up again, I got a message in my “support inbox” with an apology saying “Sorry. We made a mistake,” citing a comment on a post from March that they said “violated community terms” (which obviously did not - the comment simply contributed to a zoning conversation, agreeing that my home town didn’t need another dollar store). 

HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF

First of all, if you have a “business manager,” or “ads manager” account, add someone you trust (or multiple people) as an admin/s (i.e a parent, sibling, best friend, etc.). This way if your account is banned, you can still access your business manager/ads manager through them, and you won’t be left up shit creek with zero access to your or your clients’ business endeavors. 

Second, the AI bots are out of control and the customer service is nonexistent. Do yourself a favor and THOROUGHLY READ THROUGH THEIR COMMUNITY STANDARDS. (Simply Google it.) When I say thoroughly, I mean where it says “Read More” under the main headings/descriptions, do it. That’s where the real details and examples are. I did this after being disabled to see if there was anything I did to qualify for being banned. I learned that you can literally be banned for calling someone an idiot or stupid. (How 99% of fb users are still active with that rule is beyond me.) The rules, sorry “guidelines” are unbelievably strict — they basically seem to be written to be able to justify banning anyone for anything. 

Watch yourselves. Facebook is a private company. They can do whatever tf they want. If you truly value your memories or that platform, do yourself a favor and just be polite. Don’t post political shit (that’s on their list, too), don’t be a dick (or even say that phrase), don’t do anything that could cause them to ban you. The few seconds of power you feel for “putting someone in their place” or venting about the world with your opinions is NOT worth losing a decade + of memories, connections, and/or your business model. 

Or ignore me. I do realize this sounds like I’m screaming “cater to Big Brother,” and in essence, I am. But if you choose to ignore me, don’t whine about it later when you’re banned after telling a Karen that she can eat shit, then wonder why you can’t log in anymore. (Heads up: “eat shit” is one of their no-no phrases, too.)

If you’re like me and have been playing it safe all along and still get banned or disabled, re-read the above for what I did to get it back. Not 100% sure it’ll help, but definitely worth a try. 

Good luck to all of you!",facebook
Desktop messenger has just got worse and worse,[removed],facebook
"Desktop messenger has removed features each update, and is nearly unusable now compared to its older versions. Why is that?","Every time they change the desktop site, the messages get worse. Notable changes I can remember:

- I stopped using facebook.com for messages becasue of annoying notis from the social media, so I swapped to messenger.com

- messenger.com now has a 70ish% chance of failing to send photos. You can fix this by using facebook.com/messages/t/

- they changed facebook.com/messages/t/ to now have the notifications bar, and you get notification pop ups while using messenger on it

- They just totally removed polls and events. It took nearly a full year to get polls back, and events are nowhere to be seen. Why??? These were features my group chats used *all the time!*

And now the recent ""update"":

- Anywhere from 1-10 second hang time when changing between chats

- The chance of photos sending is now totally luck based. Sometimes it refuses to, sometimes it works fine.

- Receiving/sending messages doesn't scroll the page down. Sometimes the website freezes for like ten seconds before you can see new messages (including your own) 

- You have to click the burger next to a photo to click ""reply"", but not for normal messages. It takes up the same amount of space!! Why??? Just leave the arrow there!

- YOU CAN'T CLICK THE WHITESPACE TO SELECT THE TEXT BOX! This is the most frustrating one!!! It used to be you could basically click anywhere in the tab and start typing (like discord) but now you HAVE to click the bar at the bottom of the screen.

- If you have the info bar open, [it covers half of the message box if the window is snapped.](https://imgur.com/a/5QfqJ6v) You can close it, but when you fullscreen the window then the screen is horribly stretched and you have to reopen it again. Annoying if you're swapping between the two.

- You can't search your messages anymore?? Just totally removed the feature...

- They moved the ""add people"" button to the bottom of the list of names instead of it being in the other section, so if you're in a group chat with a lot of people it takes aaages to get to the bottom and get it.

- Videos always autoplay and are muted, but don't unmute when you click them. You have to  hover over and click the volume button, set it to the right level, and then move it back to the start and press play. Just... start them paused... and play with audio when I press play.. please...

- You can't view old photos in a grid anymore. You can only have the carousel or scroll down the image history in rows of three.

- Minor one lol but it turns :3 into a cat face emoji, even though it stopped doing that for a while. 

Most of all, I just can't get over how much slower it is. They also unified messenger.com to be the exact same chat client, so it's not even an alternative to messages/t/ anymore. It shouldn't be faster for me to go and get my phone to just use messenger normally...  I know the majority of fb users are mobile, but it seems ridiculous to update the desktop version *just to make it worse!* What features have they even added in the last five years?

And before people ask: I have a high end pc, good internet, and several of my friends share these issues. It's not just me.  I would happily move all my group chats to discord, but it doesn't have features like the messenger bubble on mobile, and some of my less tech literate friends/family just don't understand it at all. Facebook is much more ubiquitous.

tl;dr: Messenger on desktop gets worse every update for seemingly no reason.",facebook

My page button shows Discover, Likes, Invites.  Nothing about top fans.  
And I don't have a community page anywhere (I think that's in the classic mode, and I'm in the new mode).

My top fans button is ""on"" and I've seen people post on my page with the ""top fan"" icon on their name.

Hey guys, I had a 14 year old FB account disabled with only one warning beforehand. Then I had 2 more disabled within a month of their conceptions, all without warning or any reason. Facebook won’t reverse the decisions and I don’t even know what I did wrong.

I got hacked weeks ago and can’t generate code for my account. Facebook has done nothing to help.,"
So first off, Hi, this is my first post ever on Reddit. I was content to be a lurker who mostly used Reddit for its nsfw content, but Facebook has forced my hand and here I am. 

Nearly a month ago, my Facebook was hacked. No big deal, right? Except that my recovery email was an old one I don’t use anymore and didn’t have access to. I thought I had updated it. Okay, my bad. Except Facebook doesn’t give you options for if your recovery email is not accessible. As a last ditch effort, I submitted my Drivers License and waited. And waited. And waited. Meanwhile, my credit/debit cards, which were linked to my account were charged multiple times, despite me reporting my account as hacked. To the tune of eventually over $300. You might be wondering why I didn’t cancel my cards the first time -  oh I did, but somehow the new card got linked to my account (without me adding it) and charged again. I don’t even fully understand how that happened. The whole time I’ve been locked out of my account because I need to log in to generate a code to enter that code in order to log in. Do you see the problem?

I’ve been reporting and messaging and asking friends to report my page as hacked and Facebook has been silent.  As you might already be aware, there’s no direct way to contact the company, so I’ve resorted to using a variety of platforms and tagging them in post to try to be heard by somebody.  I don’t think they give a damn anymore about our little problems with their platform since I’ve realized there are hundreds if not thousands of others in my position. The fact that I’ve been reporting the issue for a month with complete radio silence is ridiculous, and if anyone else has been through this, I really feel for you because it is not fun. Frankly, it’s enough to make me want to quit Facebook altogether. That, or make a better social media platform. I’ve had it with Facebook, and 
I guess this is a last attempt to reach someone before I have to go for nuclear options (figuratively of course).

TL:DR My Facebook got hacked and despite multiple attempts to get help they have done nothing so here I am.",facebook

 2. ""Violation of community standards"" I posted asking if anyone knew of a good local gun range. This is not against the rules.

3. The comment i posted today that had be auto suspended in under 10 seconds of posting. Guy on an ice fishing forum was calling anyone who needs to borrow an auger "" a little bitch""

I said ""bro you're the one sounding like a bitch, take the hint, the sticky of this group says ""if you don't want to be a helpful or friendly fisherman this isn't the group for you""  we don't want your attitude here""

Was it Facebook who locked me out of my account today?,[removed],facebook
"I got hacked 2 weeks ago, was able to recover my account but then got locked and got me account kinda deactivated today, not sure if Facebook's fault or hackers again."," 

Just before I start, I just wanna say that I was already able to access my Facebook once again through my email and using Facebook's 3-step verification system. I just wanted to know why I got locked today.

So, to start it off, 2 weeks ago, I got my Facebook hacked through a kind of virus chain message that I opened. This hack basically sent the same virus I got sent to around 300 people. After this happened, I changed all my passwords on Facebook, email and other accounts connected to Facebook. After this, I felt safe again with my account, I also became more cautious at opening links on messages.

However, around an hour ago, while I was chatting with my SO, my messenger suddenly got logged out and I tried logging in but couldn't. My SO then messages me through another app and told me that something happened with my Facebook again. Apparently, all my messages became unavailable and my account was gone and could not be searched (I was lost on his friends list as well), basically seemed like it was deactivated, but not by me. I was able to receive an email from Facebook regarding this activity and received a recovery link, at first the link did not work but eventually it did. I went through Facebook's 3-step verification system to recover my account and thankfully, was able to. After recovering my account, my SO told me that everything was back to normal now. I also, checked my posts and messages and nothing seemed to be posted or sent by a hacker, so now I think it was Facebook who locked me out of my account (maybe due to my account being hacked last time), but then is Facebook even capable of doing that?

That is all I believe, also, is there something that I could do to make sure something like this would not happen again? Thank you.",facebook

A few years back I had a live video removed. Not a 24 hr story. But proper live recording. For some reason FB deleted it. Saying they are sorry and they can’t get it back due to an error on a server.

"My password was incorrect, so I've tried multiple ways to reset it and prove my identity to log into my account but I am locked out because I'm not receiving any emails from them"," This morning I tried to log in to Facebook and it said my password was incorrect.

I clicked the Forgotten Password button and it said they would send me a reset email but one never arrived so I clicked the ""didn't get a code"" button and it asked me for a new email address or phone number to use as recovery and then to get three codes from some trusted contacts.

Got the codes from my contacts, and then it said ""Congratulations, you have successfully proven your identity. Check your email...if you have not received an email in 30 minutes check the Help Centre"".

No email, so I checked the help centre and it's all about resetting your password by receiving a code via email (which never arrives) or I can click ""I think my account has been hacked"" which asks me to put in a new or old password, but when I do it tells me it's incorrect.

I have checked and triple checked the new email address I put in for recovery and it's definitely correct with no typos.  
I have tried to get to their support system, but low and behold I have to log in to be able to access it.  
I have tried to message/tweet them on Twitter but I don't expect that to get answered tbh.

My account was hacked in 2011,[removed],facebook
"My account was hacked back in 2011, didnt really care back then but now i have been trying to get the account back. I reached out to Facebook through Facebook Community but no asnwers.","My account was hacked back in 2011 and back then its really hard to recover an account that was hacked (they also change the email). So then i created a new account and tried to forget about it. A couple days ago it crossed my mind that the photos, message, games and all of the good memories that my hacked account possess started to irritates me. I've been trying to get back to that account, but since the email was changed and i dont know what the email is, i cannot recover the account. I have proofs that this account belongs to me ([https://www.facebook.com/jelek182/](https://www.facebook.com/jelek182/)).  


First proof is obviously the name matches. I can verify it with my Government-issued ID.  


Second proof is that when you go to about &gt; family and relationships, my mother's facebook account is listed as the account's mother and i can verify it 100% since my mother still use facebook regularly (screenshot attached).  


Third proof is back in 2011 when i created a new account since this account was hacked, i messaged my old account basically showing emotions since i just got hacked (screenshot attached).  


I have visited [https://www.facebook.com/hacked/](https://www.facebook.com/hacked/) and tried to recover from that but since the email was changed by the hacker i couldnt do a thing about it. I have tried many options but still no progress.  


I was thinking since my old account listed my mother's main facebook account as the mother i could ask my mother to recover it with her account (as shown in here [https://www.facebook.com/help/231208473756221/?ref=u2u](https://www.facebook.com/help/231208473756221/?ref=u2u)) but no, she couldnt. I still need to know the email which only the hacker knows.  


This is truly my last hope in recovering that account, looking forward for answers, thanks.

My relationship status automatically posted on both parties timeline without approval,"Life Events Publishing Question

So it’s been almost 10 years since I personally changed my relationship status on Facebook, and in updating my relationship status it asked “with who” and when I’ve entered who it has NEVER published on both parties timelines until the other person accepts or approves pending request... (the last time the guy has usually been the one to update his status but even then it’s given me the choice to approve, before published on my timeline.) 
So can someone please explain why when I changed my status yesterday it literally tagged and shared on not only my wall but also the person I tagged/requested without him even accepting or approving pending request... 
When I woke up this morning to a bunch of notifications from even people I don’t know... and instead of questioning ‘with who’, from people on my list .... it was congrats and a bunch of other wonderful comments, likes, and hearts, from people/friends on both our pages... I kinda felt awkward when I went to the post and realized it was on both our timelins ... yet, he never accepted or approved the request his public information still shows single. (Not a big deal, I didn’t expect him to approve or accept, I had a different agenda all together, won’t explain myself in this post). Feel like I should delete ... yet, at the same time everyone’s reaction is comforting.

Locked Out of Facebook Account Pending ID Submission and Review - Will I Realistically Get My Account Back Soon?,"Hello All,

Last night I was attempting to link a Shopify account to my Facebook account and for some reason it triggered an alert with their AI making it think someone was trying to hack in to my account.

I did not know about this infraction until January of this year when I created a FB business account. Within a week the business account was restricted from the advertising tools from the FB business tools.

I attempted to appeal this several times, but about 4 months ago when trying to talk to FB's chat support I was informed that it was a final decision to disable my ad account and the decision would not be reversed.

I attempted to create a new personal account, but that was deleted for ""violation"" within an hour of it being created.

Fast forward about 3 months from that and I deleted my 10-year-old account and created a new account (this was 2 weeks ago).

I waited for 24 hrs after created this now 3rd account before created the FB business manager account. During this process, I found that the FB business page that was created by the first account was also flagged.

So I tried making a second business page...24 hrs after the biz page was created, the 3rd personal account was deleted for the same ""violation"" the second was deleted.

I again tried to appeal this decision, but they said it was final.

I have no idea what to do now...does Facebook blacklist people for some reason.

All because of some repost I put up in 2015?

Facebook has disabled my account and won't say why. I generally post very boring things: here's a picture of me with a friend smiling. I don't post things that are racey and most of my posts are somewhat dull.

No one seems to answer my emails. They said they will review things, but I'm 99% sure they won't. They probably just requested a photo so the AI can ban me with facial recognition?

I’ve had this account for 12 years with lots of memories, pets passing away, getting married, birth of my son, etc. Makes me a bit sad. I don’t live close to my family and especially with the pandemic it gives many of them the chance to see pics of my kid all at once and easily stay in touch.

I primarily post pics of my kid, some scenic stuff, etc. I refrain from any political or religious posts as that is my way normally anyway. Maybe I said a bad word somewhere in a post over these 12 years and now they are hitting me for old stuff? No idea really.

Pretty crazy how they are doing this to people. I manage a few business pages of my own and for clients. Now my own will be dead since no one else were admins.

Looking in earnest for anyone who works for Facebook to resolve an issue with restoring an account that was disabled in error,"I would like to know if Facebook admins or personnel are a part of this subreddit? I strongly believe my account was mistakenly blocked recently (which was not hacked as far as I can tell when I checked from my mom's account.) I've been using my account for nearly 10 years now without any issue what so ever. I rarely post on, as I mainly used it for reading and viewing photos and messenger. I think the last time I actually posted was in 2013, a photo when I met Dennis Anderson at a monster truck show. Other than that I occasionally comment on a family or friend's post and that's it, just friendly, benign stuff.

The only thing I could even remotely think of could be one of the two apps I had been trying on my phone (Maki and Phoenix) to evaluate which one works better, or possibly with the Facebook messenger plugin for Pidgin IM that I use on desktop; one of those might have some how triggered something the servers didn't like perhaps.

I had sent my official ID but still haven't head back. Instead I was greeted by a message stating ""*Your Facebook account was disabled because it did not follow our Community Standards. We have already reviewed this decision and it cannot be reversed*""

I did receive a rather vague email from a *case++aazqexwvofamnp@support.facebook.com* stating ""*Thanks for contacting us. We've reviewed your account and confirmed that it still doesn't follow our Community Standards. As a result, your account remains disabled.*"" to which I replied again, along with my ID attached (after looking at the email headers) but haven't heard anything back.

I also tried sending a direct message to @Facebook on Twitter after I saw a mention on a site I found when searching for other ways to contact FB, but haven't received any reply there either.

It is incredibly frustrating when I know I haven't been doing anything even remotely malicious, where I'm just slammed with a block completely out of the blue, without any sort of explanation or description what they thought the problem is, no information what so ever. And to top it off, there isn't any sort of phone or direct email support, just web forms that wont even function now.

So if there is anyone that can actually help, I'd appreciate some contact. Thank you and I wish the best.",facebook

So recently my Facebook account was hacked and the email on the account was changed from my email address to one I don’t recognize at all. I went through every option on facebook’s help website to report the account but I just kept getting routed back to securing my Facebook page through the email it was hacked by. That obviously won’t work so I kept pushing until I finally got the option to send a picture of my ID to Facebook so they can see that my email is the one that is supposed to be associated with the account. 

Well, after a week Facebook finally got back to me and said that they got my ID but, “it looks like the issue has already been resolved”. It said to respond to that email if I had further concerns and they will try to help. So I check and the email on my Facebook page is still wrong and I still can’t get into the account, so I respond to their email with a detailed account of what’s wrong. I immediately get an email back that says they need my ID before they can help me. So basically this is going nowhere and I have no idea what to do. If I could even just delete the account now I would do that. I have professional contacts and professors on there, I really would like this to be resolved. Please help!!! Any advice is appreciated!",facebook

"I'm planning to create a new Facebook account. How do I merge multiple social circles. Friends, Family, Old Classmates and Coworkers that all know different things about me and might not get along? [Long Post]","I'm planning to create a Facebook account soon, mostly to fulfill the requirement to use my Oculus Quest 2 VR headset (you need an active Facebook account to use it). But I've been wanting to create a Facebook account anyway for a while now. I'm not great at staying in touch with people and have lost contact with a lot of friends and family over the years. 

I've created 2 Facebook accounts in the past. The first I created was in 5th grade, around the time when Farmville was a thing, and I really didn't get into the social features at all. I played Farmville, and when I stopped playing Farmville, I stopped using Facebook. A few years later one of my family members noticed that I misspelled my own name on the account. 

When I moved between states, I came out as gay and didn't bother to tell anyone in my old home state. I have a very Catholic family and went to a catholic school. 

When I started highschool, in the new state I was living in, I decided to create another Facebook account. Intentionally separate from my first, where I could be open about my sexuality. To hide my account from the people who knew me in my home state, I used a different first name. Naming myself cringe-inducingly after a Disney character, but keeping my last name. 

I didn't play any games on this second Facebook account, and attempted to use it for its social features. Honestly it just felt like a chore. 

Since then, I've tried logging in a few times now, and can never really stay committed to it. It's just boring to me. It *is* a chore. 

I'm too self conscious to take photos of myself, I never like how they look. I don't travel, I don't go out, I took 1 semester of community college and was stuck in a job that I hated for 4 years. Currently I'm trying to improve on things. I got a new job, before Covid started I started going to the gym and I plan to go back to school in the fall. I don't want to advertise to everyone that I'm still trying to get my life together. All of my friends are happy, healthy and dating. Facebook feels like a giant mirror reminding me how far behind them I am. I know that's kind of an illusion, the social media effect, but I'd still feel compelled to put myself out there when I'm not really comfortable with doing so. 

The last time I logged on was at least 5 years ago, and I remember getting bombarded with messages from people asking how I'm doing and what I've been up to since we last spoke. It felt so overwhelming. I want to get back into contact with those people, but I've never felt like I had the energy to do so. 

Now is the time to do that I guess. 

My only contact with family members from my home state was through my grandmother. I'd call her and she'd tell me how everyone was doing. She passed away recently, and with that, I don't have any other way of staying in touch. 

I have no contact with friends from grade to middle school, and what little contact I maintained with my friends in high school is deteriorating. One of my closest friends is moving to Washington soon. 

I want to stay in touch with all of these people and to get back in touch with people I haven't spoken to in years. 

Currently my plan is to create one brand new Facebook account as a nice clean fresh start. I may go back and review my old friends lists, and see who I should add to this new account, and delete my old accounts if possible. 

But I don't know who to friend on there or how to balance the different people that I know. There are some who still don't know I'm gay, and many others who do know. I have family members, friends from gradeschool, high school, and coworkers, and I don't necessarily want those different groups of people mixing. I behave differently around all of them, and I'm scared some of them will be judgmental towards the others. Or more likely be judgemental of me based on who I hang out with. I'm very left leaning politically, but I still love my right leaning family members. I don't know how to balance this, I want to preserve my relationships with all of them, but I don't think I'm ready to tell my very Catholic aunts and uncles that I'm gay and have a very loving partner now. 

What should I do? How should I move forward? Any advise would be appreciated.",facebook

We can't appeal the ban or do anything, Facebook's customer support is basically non-existent. No email or anything to contact to appeal the decision whatsoever.",facebook

I was hit with one about 3 months ago, a 30 day ban given despite appealing an obviously incorrect call. It said the post was deleted and i served my ban.

FFWD to just now - that exact same post has been resurrected and I just got a 60 ban for it. I appealed and, of course, it was immediately denied again (gee, the same AI made the same decision? 🤦🏼‍♂️)

I did a search and this same post was STILL there. I just deleted it manually. This just makes no sense! If the post is offensive enough that even after a claimed review you still ban me - why wouldn’t you delete said post? That’s how it worked in the past.

My facebook account is deactivated because of the facebook business function," 

One day I discovered the facebook bussiness  and tried to create an account but got an error. After trying again, facebook has locked my account with the reason ""help you secure your account"". They asked me to verify my identity, but immediately said they could not verify my identity. It's a quirky infinite loop I can't escape.

They email me ""someone else has logged in to your account"" and send me the login link but I can't use it. I can't figure out any way to recover my account or contact facebook support, no email, no similar cases to report. There's no way to tell facebook ""I don't need your security, please give me your account back"". I couldn't understand, they just locked my account without consulting, had no recovery option and said it was for helping me secure my account?

20 years of internet use. I have never seen a company consider customers as animals as facebook. Without any respect, arbitrarily do everything without consulting customers. My account is not hacked, no one has a passwork, I don't need security, please return my account.  
Thanks if someone helps me get my account back. This account I have been using for 2 years, unfortunately there is no real name, I don't remember the date of birth that I wrote down, but nonetheless there is no option to get the account back.

"Does Facebook shadow-ban or exclude posts from the feed, with ""donate"" or related keywords, but not using FB's built-in fundraiser features?","I have noticed that whenever I create a post, whether a link, text post, or anything that has certain keywords, like ""donate"" in it, Facebook adds a little banner to the top of the post asking me if I want to use Facebook's built-in fundraising features, which have separate features for non-profits and personal fundraisers. I always dismiss it, because I don't want to use these features.

But I've noticed that posts like this nearly always get record low engagement, often none at all other than my own likes. This has been true both of posts on pages, and posts on my own news feed.

I noticed it particularly glaringly recently, when I posted something that wasn't even directly asking for money, but rather, just posting a brief thank-you post acknowledging three recent anonymous donors. Normally, any sort of brief, positive post like this gets good engagement. The post got no likes other than myself, and when I reshared it to my timeline it only got 1 like, which is from a person who subscribes to my feed in notifications and generally likes all my posts.

This contrasts glaringly with the normal level of engagement on my posts. I don't post frequently, but engagement is consistently high. For example on this page, my most recent posts had: 9 likes / 2 comments / shares, 6 likes / 3 shares, 7 likes / 1 share.

On my news feed the contrast is more dramatic. Other recent posts got 19 likes / 14 comments, 23 likes / 3 comments, 5 likes, 27 likes / 12 comments.

Now, I know it could be that people just don't like or want to see fundraising-related content in their feed, so they don't engage with it.

But I'm wondering if there could be an additional factor at play. Facebook clearly recognizes certain posts as fundraising-related, using certain keywords, because it displays that banner at the top of them. And then when I clear out of it, those posts never get any engagement. And it makes me really suspicious.

I'm curious if other people have experienced anything like this, and if you all have any theories or evidence one way or the other. I tried searching extensively on this but I couldn't find any mention of this topic which is why I decided to create this post here.",facebook

How are there groups where men can post pics of nearly nude women without their permission but if I post my own sexy (completely covered) pics I get restricted??,"I've had 3 restrictions.

That was the same situation with my 2nd restriction but it will no longer let me see that comment in the dashboard. 

Today I got a 7 day restriction for posting my own sexy pics with literally everything covered but I was alluding to sex. However I have a friend who invited me to a group where men post sexual images of women with huge tits without their permission. 

So facebook just isn't ok with WOMEN posting pics of THEIR OWN BODIES in anyway that alludes to sex but men can post flat out sexual images talking about what they'd do to the women?! 

Community standards are a great thing but how is it ok to say all women lie about rape (27 accusations against a man is just women trying to get him canceled) and that libtards should be killed and religious people can talk shit about trans and gay people but we can't post images of ourselves that seems TOO SEXUAL? thats a matter of opinion whats ""too sexual"". 

It says ""no sexualized slang, hints or suggestive speech.  No language that describes sex or arousal. No sexual tantric or erotic messages."" Wtf thats half my feed!!! Plus I'm a fucking adult and only have adults on my feed. Seems like it can get out of control to allow opinions to be a part of standards. 

I wanted higher standards so people couldn't talk shit about lgbtq or threaten violence. Ive reported porn before and been told it doesn't go against standards. Porn stars and models have their own pages. Only fans models have their own pages. Men get to post claims about ""lying ass females"" but I cant post something they consider SEXUALIZED? when will bikini pics not be allowed any more? Where does the line get drawn?

I have never violated any community standards.  I don't understand how my account was hacked and reviewed by Facebook (incorrectly) over the course of one night.  I’ve been a member of Facebook since 2004.  My personal account “Dan Frieber” was the sole admin of my business page “Tango Chile Sauce”, and now without my Facebook account I cannot buy ads or sponsor posts or advertise my business or anything.  I also lost my instagram account @ frieber because it was linked to my Facebook.  It is like I have been suddenly deleted from the internet.  I have lost thousands of followers and friendships.  For no reason at all.

I have not been able to get in touch with anyone at Facebook since this happened.  None of the online tools can help me, they are all dead-ends.  **I am begging someone to please look into this.  Please help me get my accounts back so that I may retake control of my business.**

My Facebook ad account number was 22379139.   I have more info upon request.

Please help.

Thank you,

Dan",facebook

Someone created their account using my email and now I would like to create a facebook account using my email.,"Facebook has a help topic on the issue of ""someone is using my email for their account"" but it's literally just telling you to ignore the emails and not actually resolve the issue.

Mass blocking of Facebook accounts,[removed],facebook
"My Facebook account was disabled, but I was not breaking Facebook rules. What should I do?","Hello.

It all started about a year ago when I was blocked on Facebook.

Facebook is very important to me because there are a lot of people I can talk to there only and it was the best platform for finding new people. For this reason, I'm pretty sure I haven't broken Facebook's rules.

One fine morning, I open Facebook and see that my account is blocked!

I was asked to send my documents. Some time after sending, when I try to authorize, I receive a message:

Your Account Has Been Disabled

You can't use Facebook because your account, or activity on it, didn't follow our Community Standards.

We have already reviewed this decision and it can't be reversed.

I tried to do a lot. I created new accounts (different IP), recently even bought existing accounts, but everything is useless. My accounts are being blocked.

Then I read that this is due to the political situation in the United States.

Many people have faced this problem. Moreover, I know a person whose Facebook business account was blocked for no reason.

And now my question is:

What can I do?

I'm preparing an official letter to Facebook Inc, but I don't know if this will help.

 I filled out around 20 appeals  and only got one email response asking for a mug shot and code two days ago and haven’t gotten any more since

Am i screwed ? Or do i just need to wait a bit ?",facebook

Unwarranted Account Disabling,[removed],facebook
"New Account Disabled - Using real name, have submitted cell number and photo. No posts have been made - what standards could I possibly have violated?","Apologies, I see a ton of posts from people with similar login issues, but I have no idea what could have prompted my account being disabled.

I ceased using my personal page for FB about 5 years ago, with no interest in getting back on so deactivated it. I now need to be an admin on a business page, so created a new account about a month ago, was added as an admin and didn't think anything of it for a month (business not open at the moment). When I attempted to login I received a message that the account was disabled and too much time had passed to review.

So, I created another account with the email domain matching the business. One day after creating this page, I received a message that the account was disabled and I would need to add a mobile number and enter the text - so did that. Yesterday when attempting to login I received a message stating that yet again the account was disabled, and I would need to send a photo for confirmation, which I did. Today upon attempting to login, I get a message that the account has been disabled, their decision cannot be reversed as I didn't follow community standards.

I cannot imagine what standards I would have failed to meet, as this account uses my real name, and I have not made a single post or comment on any page. How can I get an account going, as I need to take over this page from the person no longer associated with the business?

The AI flagged it twice at the same time and a 30 day ban was issued. I have since successfully repealed one of those bans but the second one was flagged to the ""Overwatch Board""

I had never heard of this and decided to do some digging. Some time this year Facebook created a new website called the Overwatch Board. They hand picked 40 people from around the world to judge on specific cases where you can write a testimony so to speak on why you disagree with certain decisions upon which they deliberate on it.

If you haven't seen it, check it out here - [http://www.overwatchboard.com](http://www.overwatchboard.com/)

Reading it honestly feels like the most woke North Korean Re-Education camp experience I've ever come across on Facebook but it also explains why this year Facebook seems to have become so much more finnicky to navigate the fine line of family content and the most offensive material ever posted on the internet.

By the way, the meme I posted? It was a Christmas present meme where a father gets Minecraft confused for Mein Kampf.

I posted the meme in March 2019. The AI picked it up yesterday (21 months after it was posted) because of a new change in the Community Guidelines where it's impossible to basically mention WWII without receiving a ban.",facebook

My Facebook account (both personal and business) was hacked. The recovery emails are being sent to an account I no longer access. What to do?,"So, I've had a FB account for a number of years that I don't really use much at all. I created a FB page for my business a couple months ago, and somehow the two accounts were fused together. In order to access my business account I have to log in to my personal account.

As the title says, someone hacked into my FB account and changed the password. Apparently the only recovery option is being sent to an old email address that I no longer have access to. Which is strange because i normally receive emails from FB at a different address. I thought I updated my info on the site a while back.

I've gone through all of the other recovery options, the only one that seemed hopeful was when I tried to log in from my home computer, I was asked to submit my gov't ID and provide a new email address. I got a message saying I would be contacted about next steps, that was almost two weeks ago and I've heard nothing. 

It seems crazy to me that i can't get in touch with any kind of support from FB. I get that with personal accounts there  would be limited support options, with there being billions of FB accounts out there. But for business account? Like, I'm a paying customer of FB. I buy advertising for my account, I wish to continue buying advertisements on FB for my business but I can't. Is there anything I can do to get some actual support from FB with this??",facebook

I had a potential customer message the Facebook and seem confused about the ordering process and also what we offer. This confused me because to my knowledge, this information was clearly available and we’d never had this issue before. After looking, I noticed the pinned post was missing. 


I scrolled down to where this post would have been initially posted to see if it had somehow got unpinned, but I could not find the post.

Is the only resolution reposting the policy and feeling a little spammy to be honest considering this post was just made and also advertised in October?

"Essentially locked out of FB Business account, can't run ads on connected IG account.","I'll try to keep this brief. Since last year, I haven't been able to login to my personal or business FB pages. Every time I attempt to login, I'm automatically redirected to facebook.com/business/advertising and presented with a screen promoting FB's advertising potential. There's no login button anywhere. I've tried on multiple browsers and different computers but it seems that the issue is tied to my account (my wife doesn't have any of these issues and can login without issue on any device).

Because of this issue I've been managing my ads for my business exclusively through IG. Well, today I go to run an ad and I see a warning on the final ad creation page that states, ""You can't create ads or promote your page because it's restricted from advertising"". Which is ridiculous because I've never violated any community guidelines. Anyway, there's a 'learn more' button underneath this warning so I click it and leads me to a FB login screen (which I obviously can't get into due to the issues mentioned above). 

I'm trying to see if anyone has this same issue or a solution to this issue. Idk if I'm just stuck and I also know it's pretty much impossible to reach a human at FB to try and get this resolved. So, any info or guidance would be greatly appreciated.",facebook

Not getting Notifications for event invitations (Facebook Help Community is fucking useless),"I once received 5 event invites from a Facebook group belonging to a place, where I no longer live. I clicked the ""more actions"" button on the notification and disabled event invites, thinking I was just disabling event invite notifications from this one person or this one group.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh no. Not at all. What happens is that I no longer receive any notifications for event invitations at all. 

  
I have checked ""Settings &amp; Privacy"" -&gt; ""Settings"" -&gt; ""Notifications"" -&gt; ""Events"".

On this page, everything is turned ON.

  
I have checked ""Settings &amp; Privacy"" -&gt; ""Settings"" -&gt;  ""Blocking"". I have NO friends on my restricted list, I have NO friends  blocked in blocked users, and I have NOTHING AT ALL in the list of  ""Block event invites"".

&amp;#x200B;

As far as I can tell, this is a bug with the system. I have searched extensively, and found only very few people with the same problem, and their questions haven't been answered either.  
I asked the question in the Help Community, but that place is a fucking bad joke. Nobody reads, replies or even gives you the false hope of something being done.

Visual Studio 2019 and M1 Macbook Pro - hard crashes,"So just a heads up, I have not been through 3 replacement Macs thinking it was a hardware issue only to realise Visual Studio (in this case the one that gets installed with Unity) was causing hard lock crashes.  No idea why but I removed it and changed to Visual Studio Code and no more issues.

I do not know if it is some interplay between Unity and VS running at the same time but it was 100% that causing it - only thing remotely interesting with my setup is that I use an external 4k hdr monitor also and no extra apps installed running apart from LastPass.

So just incase anyone else has this problem - try swapping to Code.

Can't Listen on iTunes,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but I cannot find an answer anywhere.  I have an Apple Music subscription through Verizon that works great on my iPhone.  However, I cannot actually listen to music I don't have on iTunes on my Macbook.  For example, I can add a song to my library on my phone and it will allow me to play it on my Macbook, but if I haven't already added the song and just want to go listen to Music on my computer, it asks me to sign up for Apple Music.  The Verizon website says 

""Can I use my Apple Music subscription from Verizon on other devices besides my smartphone?

Yes, if you log in to iTunes or the Music app with the Apple ID that 's getting Apple Music from Verizon, you can access your saved music and playlists.""

Does this mean it's working like it should in that I can access my saved stuff but nothing new or is something wrong?

I am logged in with the same ID on all devices.  Apple Music works on my iPad which is wifi only and not associated with Verizon in anyway.

"Build your own iOS keyboard with my first SwiftUI app, Keybuild!","This week, I launched version 1.0 of my first SwiftUI app, Keybuild! 🥳
It's the app I wish I had while I was studying at university.

----

My long-standing frustration with software keyboards is that they still all use the same standard layout, providing the exact same set of symbols. Yet we all have our favourite emoji, and when you're learning any technical subjects, you'll know there's all sorts of obscure symbols to learn, none of which can be typed directly.

Keybuild is an app which lets you create your own keyboard. Starting with one of the built-in templates, you can change any of the keys to type whatever symbol you like. But it doesn't stop there.

Keybuild isn't just a keyboard editor, it's a keyboard builder. You can build your whole keyboard, from scratch if you choose, using a stack-based layout system. Fancy a number row above your keyboard, but don't want to fork out for the 12.9"" iPad? Fancy no longer, you can add one right in! Or add a dismiss button into your iPhone keyboard, to help reclaim precious screen real-estate at a touch!

Is one keyboard not enough? Needs reams and reams of symbols and emoji? Build multiple layouts, called ‘Panes’, and switch between them using either a direct Pane Link, or a ‘Pane Menu’ which presents a quick-switcher of all your panes. There's a few pane templates built-in, including the iOS Qwerty layouts for various device sizes, the default symbols pane, and a new custom one - extended symbols!

----

Keybuild is available now on the App Store → https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/keybuild/id1547174534

The app is a small, one-time purchase! My next update will add built-in symbol &amp; emoji search, to render copy &amp; paste fully obsolete. 😉",apple

We've released Ekko - a shared digital photo-frame widget for your homescreen you can use with your friends and family!,"Hi /r/Apple!

A few months ago my brother and I started work on a widget idea we both thought was pretty cool, and after lots of great feedback we've recently released it on the App Store.


The app is called **Ekko**, and it's a **shared digital photo frame widget for your iPhone and iPad**, where your friends and family can update which pictures are shown on the widget (and you can update theirs). We think of it like a little portal on your homescreen controlled by your friends and family. 


We've called it ""Ekko"", because the picture you post are ""echoed"" to the devices of everyone in the same stream, but eventually disappear :)


Using Ekko is super simple. First, you join or create a photo stream with the people you want to share with. Once you're in, you can post pictures to the stream and they'll appear in everyone's widget. You can also like and comment on the pictures in your streams, and after 24 hours, the photos disappear (except the most recent shown in the widget). There's also a cool giftwrapping feature where your picture will appear as a present on their homescreen until they open the app and unwrap it (you can re-wrap it too). 


Ekko has a premium mode which gives a few extra features, but we're giving that away for free for the first few hundred signups so we can see how people use the app and get more feedback! :)


A couple of weeks ago we shared Ekko on /r/iphone and had a great response, and lots of fantastic feedback - particularly from couples - but also from larger groups of friends and families keeping in touch. Since then we've released the iPad version, and some of our friends have tested it on M1, which apparently works perfectly. We don't have an M1 to hand, but if anyone here does and wants to test out Ekko, please let us know how it goes!


We're really excited to share Ekko with you, and we use it every day with our friends and family. We'd love to hear what you think!

"I just launched Pins, a modern Pinboard app for iOS 14 and macOS Big Sur","As a long time Pinboard.in user of 11 years, I got 20,000 bookmarks stored in my account. I've been looking for a modern app for a while but there's no such thing. Took the matter in my own hands and make Pins. 

(For those who haven't heard of it, Pinboard is a social bookmarking website with a plain design and a focus on personal management of bookmarks using tags to organize them, similar to early versions of Delicious)

Pins works very well with accounts of all sizes. No matter how many bookmarks you have — from 1,000 to even 100,000 — Pins can handle it.

Blurb: Offline access to all Pinboard bookmarks. Filter with smart collections. Share extension, drag-and-drop, Shortcuts app. Widgets, Spotlight search, Handoff, multitasking.

Give it a try! It's available here: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pins-for-pinboard/id1547106997",apple

"I just launched a new text replacement app this month, and it got featured by Apple 🥳","Hi all! Textcraft is a magical utility that allows you to transform any text in real-time into a variety of 90+ different formats.

It’s built with iOS design guidelines in mind to look great in light and dark mode alike, along with containing multiple tints and themes to tweak the app your way. The intuitive ‘tap to copy’, and ‘long-press to share’ gestures coupled with the keyboard shortcuts also makes using the app super simple to pick up and use.

Multi-window support coupled with Drag and Drop is also extremely useful for quickly and easily dragging text from other apps directly into the app for quick transforming. Whether this is to add hashtags to words social picture sharing sites, or mimic mocking Spongebob in conversation with your friends, there’s something for everyone. There are also various ASCII text face emoticons for quick and easy copying.

I’d love to know your thoughts. It can be found through here: https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/textcraft/id1546719359

To celebrate the launch, ten lucky commenters will receive a copy of the app for free.

"We made a Note taking app which is basically a cross between Bear, Apple Notes &amp; Ulysses, and it’s really beautiful and easy to use. Awarded best design &amp; top app of 2020 by Airport!","Hi r/Apple,

After spending 2 years building, iterating &amp; improving, we finally created Spaces. Create beautiful notes, add infinite tags &amp; connect everything via backlinks, all in real time.

To build the best possible experience we analysed over 25 top writing apps (including Bear, Agenda, Things, Ulysses, iAWriter &amp; more) to create the best design &amp; add most essential features.

Our main vision while building Spaces was to create a clean, distraction-free writing environment. Here's what we built to achieve that:

1. Instant Markdown with automatically hiding syntax (as soon as you move your cursor away).
2. Instant tagging using hashtags with unlimited nesting.
3. Focus Mode &amp; Mark Line that highlights the current line/paragraph.
4. Automatic suggestion of tags based on your past usage.
5. No need of selecting a word to format it, just put your cursor on it &amp; choose the formatting.
6. Live updating word count in the toolbar (in touchbar for MacOS).

Apart from editor, we also paid a lot of attention to design.

1. Placed majority of the options at the bottom for better UX (phones are getting bigger) &amp; so that the user never sees any option while the keyboard is open.
2. Added drag &amp; drop support, keyboard shortcuts &amp; a spotlight like search.
3. Added small, less noticed but essential things missing from other writing apps like multiple selection, proper sectioning between pinned &amp; unpinned notes, add to favorites, sub formatting inside todos, lists and headings etc.

We’ve been beta testing it for around 5 months, did a soft launch recently and we’ve received great response along with lots of feature requests. Can’t wait to hear what you guys think :)

Link: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spaces/id1509611686

PS - Last time we posted (2 weeks back), the post was removed in a few minutes because of not being active in the community. Have been active since then and took the permission of mods before posting. Anyways, the suggestions we got during that time have all been implemented. So the app is even better now :)

We also have a subbreddit r/SpacesApp.

Spaces is a note taking app it took us around 2 years to build. After analysing around 25 top note taking apps and changing design multiple times, we finally created the best note taking app we possible could.

It supports Instant Markdown with automatically hiding syntax.

Instant tagging using hashtags, and also custom filters.

A lot of other features missing from other apps like instant word count, multiple selection, in keyboard toolbar &amp; more.

The design is totally distraction free (all button are at bottom). There is pinning, favorites, archive, bin, todos &amp; more. 

The app is built natively on each platform and is only Apply exclusive. Have been beta testing it for a long time and I think you all will really love it!

Do you like Sudoku? Bring your Apple Pencil - we're back with some codes!,"Hi everyone!

First off, a massive **thank you** to everyone who downloaded our little game, gave us input, and took the time to say hi. 

Our aim from day one has been to create the perfect Apple-esque Sudoku puzzler, with as many customisation options as possible. We think we did an alright job, but obviously there's always room for improvement. If you'd like to check our game out, [you can download it for free right here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sudoku-master-edition-logic/id1260190370). The only IAP is to get rid of ads.

Making this app has been a dream come true, and it has enabled us to start working on more puzzlers (coming in early 2021 to an i-device near you). We're not a massive studio, we're a husband and wife team trying to make simple apps even better.

**Here's what's already being worked on:**

* Our scoring system is getting a much-needed overhaul. It'll be more coherent across difficulties, mistakes made, and time elapsed - versus just being the simple multiplier it is currently.

* More themes will be added.

* The auto-filling notes button on the game screen can be toggled off / on from the game's settings.

Since posting on here last time, we added iCloud Family Sharing (no clue how we could forget that) - and we forgot to drop a few codes last time, so we wanted to make up for that today. The codes remove ads for good - have fun:

WordSearch Solver - Scan Words To Find Answers (50 Promo Codes),"Hey everyone!

I've been learning Vision (which allows the camera to scan characters) in my free time and I decided to make an app to prove that I could finally understand and use Vision - I'm really proud of what I made and to celebrate I'm giving away 50 codes for an IAP (as the app itself is free).

WordSearch Solver allows you to scan any nearby word searches to display hints and exact locations for any words you cannot find. The app is beautiful and simple to interact with at the same time. I wanted it to be heavily iOS-centric and use many of the design elements present throughout iOS. The app is an iOS exclusive.

I've released version 1.0 for free as I'd love some feedback on how I could improve the user interface and other elements - maybe even add more features?

I'm all ears for any feedback, whether critical or positive.

[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wordsearch-solver-find-words/id1548104233](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wordsearch-solver-find-words/id1548104233)

"I've become frustrated with Spotify's mobile app, so I created my own. Let me know what you think about it!","Hey, fellow music lovers

If you built a huge library of music on Spotify, I'm sure you noticed how clunky and non-intuitive the interface is when it comes to browsing music saved in your account. It's clear that Spotify focuses on music discovery (and podcasts) while users who just want to enjoy songs they already know are left with really poor, bare-bones functionality. After using **iTunes** for many, many years it really felt to me like Spotify just doesn't give a heck about **music hoarders** like me 🤓

So I decided to try and build my own music app which would solve many of the headaches I've had with the official app and after 2 years of development I think it is now ready to be considered a serious alternative to it.

It's called **Plum Music Player**. It offers fresh take on music management and innovative ways to manipulate the playback queue. Some of the **unique features** include:

* **Spotify** and local music from **iTunes** in one app
* Instantly access your **favourites** from one screen
* Create **folders** for albums, artists and playlists
* **Last.fm** integration
* Intuitive **gestures** for easy one-handed operation
* Find any song from home screen with **Spotlight** and control the queue with **Widget**
* Set **home tab,** customize layouts, colors, gestures etc.

**Plum** is free to download and offers **3-day trial** which allows you to check out all of its features. **There are no ads nor subscriptions**, if you like the app you can unlock the premium features once and enjoy them forever!

[Download it for free from App Store here](https://apps.apple.com/app/plum-music-player/id1441625664)

"I created Meet Cam, a macOS app that helps to improve online meetings.","Hi /r/apple! I've recently released my new Mac app - [Meet Cam](https://meet.cam), it overlays useful widgets on your camera feed during a video meeting. The app works like a virtual camera with Zoom or Goole Meet and many others. This way you can better control meeting time, express emotions without derailing the conversation, or add some winter mood.

Here’s a highlight of some of Meet Cam's widgets you can use to boost your productivity:

* Meeting Timer - shows how much time left in the meeting
* Countdown - a countdown timer to timebox parts of a call
* Headline - one line of text at the bottom of your video 

and a few more just to bring a smile:

* Snow - in case you are missing the real one,
* Reindeers - well, yeap animated reindeers right in your camera :)

Next in line are emoji and gifs.

It's gotten some really positive feedback from early adopters - as one of the early users said ""it's like a lifejacket in a flood of Zoom meetings"" So I thought to share this here too. Let me know if you guys have any other questions. I'll be happy to answer them.",apple

"We made a Note taking app which is basically a cross between Bear, Apple Notes &amp; Ulysses, and it’s really beautiful &amp; easy to use. Awarded best design &amp; top app of 2020 on Airport!","Hi r/Apple,

We built a lot of apps before, but none of them were good enough. After spending 2 years building, iterating &amp; improving, we finally created Spaces.

To build the best possible experience we analysed over 25 top writing apps (including Bear, Agenda, Things, Ulysses, iAWriter &amp; more) to create the best design &amp; add most essential features.

Our main vision while building Spaces was to create a clean, distraction-free writing environment. Here's what we built to achieve that:

1. Instant Markdown with automatically hiding syntax (as soon as you move your cursor away).
2. Instant tagging using hashtags with unlimited nesting.
3. Focus Mode &amp; Mark Line that highlights the current line/paragraph.
4. Automatic suggestion of tags based on your past usage.
5. No need of selecting a word to format it, just put your cursor on it &amp; choose the formatting.
6. Live updating word count in the toolbar (in touchbar for MacOS).

Apart from editor, we also paid a lot of attention to design.

1. Placed majority of the options at the bottom for better UX (phones are getting bigger) &amp; so that the user never sees any option while the keyboard is open.
2. Added drag &amp; drop support, keyboard shortcuts &amp; a spotlight like search.
3. Added small, less noticed but essential things missing from other writing apps like multiple selection, proper sectioning between pinned &amp; unpinned notes, add to favorites, sub formatting inside todos, lists and headings etc.

We’ve been beta testing it for around 5 months, did a soft launch recently and we’ve received great response along with lots of feature requests. Can’t wait to hear what you guys think :)

PS - The last time we posted, the post was soon unapproved because of not being active in the community. Have been active since, and took permission of the mods before posting. Also, the few suggestions we got in the post that time, everything has been implemented, so the app is even better now :)

You can also join us on r/SpacesApp.

As a launch 🎁 offer, we are also giving a lifetime purchase option in the app.",apple

New update for my scientific &amp; engineering calculator app. Giving away 10 promo codes to 10 random commenters.,"I’ve just shipped an update to TechniCalc, which is available on iPhone (with companion Apple Watch app), iPad, and macOS.

On iPhone and iPad, you'll now be able to customise the app icon with 3 new designs based off the existing logo - including a solar system icon and a pac-man icon.

This update makes life even easier on your Mac. The new settings panel gives you the option to show TechniCalc in your menu bar and show it with a keyboard shortcut (cmd + ctrl + /). You can also have the app run on startup so the shortcut is always available.

Using degrees, radians, and gradians is even easier. This update brings a new deg and grad function that convert radians to degrees and radians, respectively. Use them on their own, or combine them with functions - like deg arcsin 0.5 - to do the conversion.

And now when you've got a lot of brackets, a focus ring will highlight the start and end of the bracket pair you're editing.

And as always, this update brings more performance and stability updates too - especially around launch times in the app (which were already excellent).

**To celebrate, I’m giving away 10 codes to 10 random commenters. Codes will be given out tomorrow morning (around 9am GMT).**

---

TechniCalc is a smart calculator for a smart phone. The modern interface that makes a clean break from traditional pocket calculators. Equations are entered in a natural way, adhering to every detail of hand-written maths.

The advanced maths engine also makes this the only calculator you’ll ever need. You’ll find your garden variety logs, sins, and cosines — but for when you need it, the engine has full support for imaginary numbers, vectors, matrices, sums and products, and differentiation and integration.

"I’ve updated my app, RunFit for Apple Watch, with lots of improvements suggested by r/Apple!","Hello! A few weeks ago, I posted about my first app, [RunFit for Apple Watch](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1530993082) and people seemed to like it. 

For those who missed it, it’s a standalone watch app for runners that allows you to display the weekly progress from your running workouts directly on your Apple Watch faces using complications. 

Since then, I have been hard at work and not long ago, I released version 1.5 that cumulatively contains a lot of the great feedback that I received on this sub:

• Made clearer what « Quality Pace » was with in app explications

• Added the option to display the quality pace in percentage instead of in minutes

• Added a new complication for quality percentage

• Added the option to start the week on Sunday instead of Monday

• Added an optional alert feature, where RunFit can send you a notification if your quality percentage for the week gets to high. It will suggest you to run slower from now one, because running fast all the times can increase your chances of injury. 

I wasn’t able to implement a trial feature yet, but I’ve lowered the price to 1.99 USD to make it even more accessible. It’s a one time purchase with no ads, no in-app purchases and absolutely no data collected.

Hope you like it, as always feel free to leave questions, comments and suggestions!",apple

Hidden - Exchange secret images with your friends,"Hi all,

I'm part of the development team of [Hidden](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hidden-secret-images/id1455724330) app. It's an iPhone app that allows users to share sensitive photos privately, while showing a public photo to everyone else.

So, user takes a photo, which will be their private photo. And then pics a public photo, from our existing list, like a cute pet animal, which will represent their public photo.

They share the public photo with everyone, but only those that have the Hidden app can see the private photo.

For a technical explanation -- that private photo is embedded inside the public photo, it is a technique called [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography)

The Hidden app is free, registration is not required and we don't collect personal information. The app is geared towards teenagers and college students to exchange photos privately by hiding them in a public photo. (In theory, it can be used by Journalists for example, who are in war zones, and are taking sensitive photos, and want to hide those private photos in a public photo that is shared).

It is just a 3 step process:

* Take private photo

* Select public photo from existing list provided in app.

* Send both pictures, one embedded in other to friends

To view the private photo inside the app, just click on public photo, and it will flip over.

Would love to hear your opinion on how to improve the app based on the info. Thank you.",apple

I created an app to build good habits and get rid of bad ones. Giving away 10 promocodes to random commenters.,"Hey guys! I am a college student and as many others I often suffer from procrastination. A while back I read a book about the importance of building small habits each day. It talks a lot about consistency and staying on track with your goals. Our whole life is build around tiny habits that we don't notice - thus by changing them - we can change who we are. So, I decided to start improving myself but could not find a perfect app that fitted my needs to track my daily habits... so I built one myself. 

With the app you are able to create habits, track them, and build a streak by completing habits daily. If you miss a day you lose your streak, actually motivating you to do your habits and become better. 

I created the app to be beautiful, minimalistic, and not overloaded with unnecessary features that distract you from the actual goal of building habits; and its a onetime small purchase unlocking all features unlike many other habit trackers which force you into expensive subscriptions (a combination which I could not find in any other app). I will be giving away promocodes to lucky commenters, so I am welcoming a discussion on building habits, general self-improvement, suggestions for the app or anything else that comes to mind :)

"We made a note-taking app which is basically a cross between Bear, Apple Notes &amp; iAWriter, and it’s really beautiful and easy to use. Awarded best design &amp; top app of 2020 on Airport!","Hi r/Apple,

After spending 2 years building, iterating &amp; improving, we finally created Spaces. Create beautiful notes, add infinite tags &amp; connect everything via backlinks, all in real time.

To build the best possible experience we analysed over 25 top writing apps (including Bear, Agenda, Things, Ulysses, iAWriter &amp; more) to create the best design &amp; add most essential features.

Our main vision while building Spaces was to create a clean, distraction-free writing environment. Here's what we built to achieve that:

1. Instant Markdown with automatically hiding syntax (as soon as you move your cursor away).

2. Instant tagging using hashtags with unlimited nesting.

3. Focus Mode &amp; Mark Line that highlights the current line/paragraph.

4. Automatic suggestion of tags based on your past usage.

5. No need of selecting a word to format it, just put your cursor on it &amp; choose the formatting.

6. Live updating word count in the toolbar (in touchbar for MacOS).

Apart from editor, we also paid a lot of attention to design.

1. Placed majority of the options at the bottom for better UX (phones are getting bigger) &amp; so that the user never sees any option while the keyboard is open.

2. Added drag &amp; drop support, keyboard shortcuts &amp; a spotlight like search.

3. Added small, less noticed but essential things missing from other writing apps like multiple selection, proper sectioning between pinned &amp; unpinned notes, add to favorites, sub formatting inside todos, lists and headings etc.

We’ve been beta testing it for around 5 months, did a soft launch recently and we’ve received great response along with lots of feature requests. Can’t wait to hear what you guys think :)

NeonBattle: My 2D-Car-Soccer-Game is now available in the App Store!,"Hello Everyone

A half year has passed since I received pretty good feedback on a video of my game [Neonbattle](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1525197549). Neonbattle is a 2d arcade game in which you play soccer with a car! I‘ve tried to add different features like a local multiplayer, online multiplayer and singleplayer using levels and a (time-based) highscore mode.

It also features GameCenter support in form of achievements!

The game is a sideproject of mine (that‘s the reason it‘s free) which I plan to improve over time.

*The game is completely free and contains no ads*

Feel free to ask me any questions! I‘m also happy to hear some feedback or ideas for improvement

"Before July 2020 I had never typed a line of code. Now, my first all is in the App Store! Introducing: WatchThisCube!","I’ve had a lifelong desire to start coding, and due to the pandemic, I finally started my coding adventure in July of 2020!

I’ve now got a MAJOR app in the works, and took a break from it to make my first ever publicly released app, WatchThissCube!

WatchThisCube is a puzzle timer app for the Apple Watch. Used for tracking your times to solve puzzles, such as Rubiks Cubes!

The timer is not meant to replace a traditional puzzle timer, such as a stackmat timer, or even a more feature rich puzzle timer app on iPhone. Rather the app is more for on the go usage! If you’re away from your phone, at a friends house and he hands you his cube off the shelf, or maybe you just didn’t want to lug anything else with you, you always have a timer on hand! 

For those of you who don’t participate in the speed solving scene, a transitional timer involves setting your hands on it to “ready” the timer. As soon as your hands lift, the timer stops, you solve the puzzle, then place your hands back on the timer to stop the time. 

The watch app works using this logic by pressing and holding on the screen to start the timer and tapping on completion! The app also saves your times from your session!

My favorite feature is **haptic inspection times!** When speed solving, traditionally you are provided 15 seconds to inspect the puzzle before solving. With WatchThisCube, with inspection time enabled, lifting your finger from the timer starts the 15 second inspection timer. However, when you have 7 seconds left, your wrist gives you a tap! 3 seconds left? Another tap! And finally a tap once 15 seconds has elapsed and the timer begins! Allowing you to keep your eyes on your puzzle and have a hands free inspection!

I’m super stoked for this app! It is simple but effective! I’ve had great enjoyment out of using it myself! And I hope you all do as well! It has been quite the ride so far!

I made a time tracking app that works by asking what you are doing instead of using timers.,"Tl;dr: I made a time tracking app that works by asking what you are doing.

Hi /r/apple, best wishes for 2021!

Years ago, I used to work as an iOS developer for a digital agency. Each Friday, I was asked to submit my hours for that week. I estimated these hours by examining emails, reviewing commits, and finding attended meetings. Like many, I experienced it as a tedious task. Yet, it was of great importance for invoicing and budgeting purposes.

I started looking for apps to help me. Most time tracking apps required me to toggle timers when switching between tasks. I often forgot to do this, making the resulting timesheets inaccurate. Other solutions followed an automatic approach by tracking the apps I used, documents I wrote, and the websites I visited. Not knowing exactly what happened with that data, I felt those apps could potentially harm my privacy.

Working on my thesis and conducting quantitative research, I realized that data sampling could be a great alternative for tracking time. Daily is the resulting implementation of that approach. It works by asking what the user is doing and provides a better way to track time without the hassle of toggling timers. It also protects the privacy of the user by not collecting data other than what the user has explicitly provided.

Fast-forwarding to 2021, thousands of employees, freelancers, founders, and other professionals working in various industries are tracking their time using Daily. They use its timesheets to submit hours, create invoices, or simply increase their productivity.

I hope it can be useful for you too, especially now as you are likely working from home and might need some help protecting your work/life balance.

Stay safe, Niels.",apple

I have added a full year free trial to my indie gym app Liftin’ so you can use it for free all through 2021. Try it out and let me know what you think! Happy new year! 🥳,"Hello r/Apple, Liftin’ developer Valter here[!](https://i.imgur.com/hFYb17x.png) 👋

[App Store Link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/liftin/id1445041669)


This past year has been terrible in so many ways, including many gyms that has struggled financially as well as previously active gym-goers has fallen out of shape (myself included).

The situation is still worse than ever in many parts of the world, but I have hopes that we sometime this year can go back to a ”more normal” way of living again.

As a small encouragement I have decided to let all new users of Liftin’ this month get a full year free trial and use it for free all through 2021. Tracking your workouts can make it easier and more fun, and I hope that some of you might rediscover the joy of lifting using the tool I have built.

Remember to follow your local restrictions and work out at home or outdoors if your area is not safe. Have patience and you will hopefully be able to return to the gym later this year!

##What’s Liftin’?

Liftin’ is an iPhone and Apple Watch app for tracking weightlifting and bodyweight exercises. I never loved any of the gym apps in the App Store (I tried them all) so I set out to build my own.

My goal was to build a tool that was really simple and easy to use but had advanced features like automatic progression and support for training max relative weights. I also wanted it to look and feel as if it was designed by Apple.

Please try it out and let me know what you think! I love feedback and I’m constantly looking for ways to improve the app!

You can get the latest updates from me at Twitter [@liftinApp](https://twitter.com/liftinapp).

Stay safe and happy new year! 💪",apple
"We made a Note-taking app which is basically a cross between Bear, Apple Notes &amp; iAWriter, and it’s really beautiful and easy to use. Awarded best design &amp; top app of 2020 on Airport!","Hi r/Apple,

Happy New Year to all.

After spending 2 years building, iterating &amp; improving, we finally created Spaces. Create beautiful notes, add infinite tags &amp; connect everything via backlinks, all in real time.

To build the best possible experience we analysed over 25 top writing apps (including Bear, Agenda, Things, Ulysses, iAWriter &amp; more) to create the best design &amp; add most essential features.

Our main vision while building Spaces was to create a clean, distraction-free writing environment. Here's what we built to achieve that:

1. Instant Markdown with automatically hiding syntax (as soon as you move your cursor away).
2. Added small, less noticed but essential things missing from other writing apps like multiple selections, proper sectioning between pinned &amp; unpinned notes, add to favorites, sub formatting inside todos, lists and headings, etc.
3. Focus Mode &amp; Mark Line that highlights the current line/paragraph.
4. Automatic suggestion of tags based on your past usage.
5. No need of selecting a word to format it, just put your cursor on it &amp; choose the formatting.
6. Live updating word count in the toolbar (in touchbar for MacOS).

Apart from editor, we also paid a lot of attention to design.

1. Placed majority of the options at the bottom for better UX (phones are getting bigger) &amp; so that the user never sees any option while the keyboard is open.
2. Added drag &amp; drop support, keyboard shortcuts &amp; a spotlight like search.
3. Added small, less noticed but essential things missing from other writing apps like multiple selection, proper sectioning between pinned &amp; unpinned notes, add to favorites, sub formatting inside todos, lists and headings etc.

We’ve been beta testing it for around 5 months, did a soft launch recently and we’ve received great response along with lots of feature requests. Can’t wait to hear what you guys think :)

"Any London Apple users (and soon beyond I hope), I made an app to find you well priced taxis!","Hello friends, I made an app called [RideHub](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/ridehub-compare-rides-taxi/id1493434189).

If you live in London and get Ubers/Bolts/Free Nows/Black Taxis/(other ride hailing apps I may support if you want it) regularly I made an app that might be helpful for you. It lets you search across multiple on demand taxi / ride hailing apps at once to check pricing, ETA and car type of various products. When you find the option you want the order button sends you through to the relevant app with your route pre populated (unless you order a Bolt, they don't support that). If you don't have the app installed it will take you to the app store for that provider.

It highlights the quickest option by pickup time as well as the cheapest of all the taxis returned for quick use. If you need something more specific there's filters for that (5 seats, disabled access etc).

We've found that our users save an average of £7.50 / trip and you can keep track of the amount you've saved by using RideHub in the savings section of the app.

It pretty much only works for London at the moment. It will work in other UK cities but without the same breadth of choice of provider. Plans for 2021 are to expand the providers across the UK and later Europe to bring delicious choice for ride hailing consumers!

**Why did you bother making this?**

After the culmination of my office Christmas party in 2019 I was drunk, tired and alone. I wanted to be home in my bed as quickly as possible. I then spent the next ten minutes flicking between multiple different ride hailing apps that either had outrageous surge pricing, ETAs of about 25 minutes or just plain no drivers about. This whole process annoyed me. I ended up spending £45 on an Uber for a 12 minute journey. So I made RideHub over that Christmas holiday.

**It doesn't have feature X that I would like**

No problem! I pretty much made this app for myself. If you want to see a particular feature or another ride app supported (will be adding some electric only ride hailing providers in the future) then just ask, we're always looking for feedback.",apple

Hi Guys! Hopefully everyone is doing fine in these unprecedented times!,[removed],apple
"We’ve just updated our game Kurit, a minimalistic UI and mechanic board puzzle game my Brother and I made last year - we'd love to hear more from you!","We've updated our game to include the following:

* Leaderboard ranking for each levels
* New “**Peek**” action that allows you to view the slot tiles under the move tiles. Useful when you’re looking for where that slot tile is!
* Added rank achievement banners when completing a level!
* Also squashed some bugs!

Since our players have been begging us for ages for an Android version, not only did we update our game, we also published just last week an Android version of the game too!

&amp;#x200B;

**What’s Kurit?**  
Kurit is a 2D puzzle-board game. Hand-crafted with a calm UI. Each level requires a different strategy to complete — another level is another game. Give it a quick look!

&amp;#x200B;

**Mechanics are fairly simple:**  
Move the colored tiles (“Move tile”) to their respective slot tile that has the same direction arrows. Directions are depicted by the three-lines on the tile.

*That easy right?*

Don’t underestimate it, but if you’re into squishing brain power for a single puzzle level, Kurit is for you!

And we have more for our hardcore puzzle-solvers too on the difficult stage! We’ve introduced some obstacle tiles, directional obstacle tiles where only the same move direction can move through, and more…

&amp;#x200B;

My brother coded the game and I designed the UI and UX for it and this is just our first game.

So if you have any suggestions, feedback, or criticism, we would love to hear back from you as we’re trying to improve it!

Download it on [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kurit/id1460425729).

We also just launched on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/kurit), give it a like if you love the game!  
Thanks fellow [r/Apple](https://www.reddit.com/r/Apple/)!",apple

I’ve released version 1.5 of RunFit for Apple Watch with lots of improvements suggested by r/Apple !,"Hello! A few weeks ago, I posted about my first app, [RunFit for Apple Watch](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1530993082). 

It’s a standalone watch app for runners that allows you to display the weekly progress from your running workouts directly on your Apple Watch faces with complications. 

Since then, I have been hard at work and yesterday I released version 1.5 that cumulatively contains a lot of the great feedback that I received on this sub:

• Made clearer what « Quality Pace » was with in app explications

• Added the option to display the quality pace in percentage instead of in minutes

• Added a new complication for quality percentage

• Added the option to start the week on Sunday instead of Monday

• Added an optional alert feature, where, RunFit can send you a notification if your quality percentage for the week gets to high. It will suggest you to run slower from now one, because running fast all the times can increase your chances of injury. 

I wasn’t able to implement a trial feature yet, but I’ve lowered the price to 1.99 USD to make it even more accessible. It’s a one time purchase with no ads, no in-app purchases and absolutely no data collected. 

Hope you like it, as always feel free to leave questions, comments and suggestions!",apple

"Tasks my indie app is now finally available on the Mac too! Featured on 9to5Mac, MacStories and MacRumor! 🚀","Hey Folks, 

[Tasks](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/tasks-to-do-lists-reminders/id1502903102) launched earlier this year in June and you’ll were fabulous, thank you for that! Just last month, Tasks launched for Mac, would love for you to try it out on any of the platforms. It is now my full time gig! 

Yet another Task manager? 
Yep, kinda, but, Tasks allows you to make kanban boards where tasks can have more statuses like “todo”, “in progress”, “verify” and “done”. It feels like a native app from Apple. You can customize so many parts of your projects which you didn’t even know you required until you try it out once! You can create tags, assign tasks unique types and everything is stored completely within your iCloud, never leaves it and I can never access it. I don’t track anything and won’t in the future. I respect each and every user’s privacy as I would like mine to be respected. 

Tasks is free for all to try and I generously have provided 2 free projects where you can try ALL the functionality without hitting the paywall except for when attempting to share a project with someone else. Hope that suffices!🌟

There is an ongoing holidays discount in the app for a couple more, it’s free with in app purchases (subscription and lifetime options which best suit you). 

What’s next? 
Siri Shortcuts, Watch app, TV app and a whole lot more. 

Read about it on [9to5Mac here!](https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/25/tasks-app-gets-update-with-new-features-macos-version-more/)

Thank you. Ask me any questions, glad to answer each and every single one of them!

"I created Metrics, an iOS app to track anything you want, with monthly views and charts, widgets, and automatic reading from health","I am an indie developer passionate about self-tracking. So I built an app, Metrics, that I use to track all kinds of stuff from health and fitness data (most of it gathered automatically from Health data) or other personal data that I enter daily (e.g: time spend working, reading).

The app offers iCloud sync, widgets, and some stats. I plan to extend it by adding a goals section. If you want to gather some stats about your 2020 steps, distance walked, heart rate, or other metrics that can read from the Health app, this is a great tool. Also, I find it very useful for daily tracking of stuff that is not automatically trackable and to build good habits, like reading, quit smoking, personal hygiene, and more.

The app is free to download and it offers by default 21 metrics, many of them synced with health. You will need a Pro subscription ($1.99 / month or $19.99/year) for custom metrics, widgets, and charts. 

I always take privacy very seriously so  I don't collect any of your data. The app doesn't store data in any external servers, I just track some stuff related to app interaction (screens visible, buttons tapped), without user tracking or identification. The data is kept local (Core Data) and it also can be synced on multiple devices via iCloud. I have no access to any health or other personal data and I don't use any external libraries that might track users.

It will be really useful to hear your opinion, so if you want to take a look and leave me some honest feedback let me know in the comments and I will offer you a promo code for a 1-month subscription (available for the first 25 people)

The app can be downloaded from here: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metrics-build-great-habits/id1492356525](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metrics-build-great-habits/id1492356525)

Many people from r/apple requested it so I added Cloud Movement to my free Weather Radar Widget app so you know if the storm is coming towards you,"Hi r/apple

After iOS 14 came out, I have made a widget app that shows Weather Radar on your home screen: [Just launched a Free Widget App for iOS 14 that shows Live Weather Radar with Dark Sky color theme. Rain and snow, supports dark mode and updates every 10 minutes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/j03wu2/just_launched_a_free_widget_app_for_ios_14_that/)   


It was greatly received on this subreddit, but one of the most requested features was the ability to see the animation of the radar, to know if the storm is moving away or towards you. Unfortunately, the widget system has some limitations, for example it’s not possible to display moving content, such as an animated weather radar.  
 

To solve this issue, Weather Radar Widget applies machine learning on series of radar images to estimate the motion of precipitation areas. This movement is then visualised on the widget as arrows showing the way, giving users clear idea of the direction that the bad weather is coming from. 

The app is free, has no ads and does not track you in any way: 

[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/weather-radar-widget/id1532959739#?platform=iphone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/weather-radar-widget/id1532959739#?platform=iphone)",apple

[Promo Sunday] ProStyle Camera by NeuralCam - shoot &amp; edit like a professional photographer,"Hey everyone,

Photo editing apps are cool and have become very popular lately, but each of them requires some amount of photo editing skill to use. Be it a basic editing app or a professional desktop application like Lightroom, it requires quite some amount of time and effort to get nice photos and even so, results are still quite different from the professional look that most users strive for. 

We just launched [ProStyle Camera](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1543452919) \- a new app and platform that aims to make photo editing significantly easier and more accessible by mixing the power of AI and the creative power of professional photographers. 

ProStyle is a photo editor and camera app that edits photos &amp; videos with one tap in the style of a professional photographer. At the same time, it’s also a platform for creating these AI powered professional editing styles and then selling them through the built-in Style Store. 

At the heart of ProStyle is a proprietary AI engine that can learn a photo editing style from a dataset of edited photos and can apply the learned style to photos taken by the user on their phone. This allows users to edit photos with one tap similar to what pro photographers achieve using professional photo editing software and years of experience, also containing the fine details of their unique editing style. 

You can download the ProStyle Camera app for free from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1543452919), try it out and let us know what you think.

We're also giving away 10 yearly promo codes for the ProStyle Membership, which unlocks the video mode, along with additional AI features and advanced UI.",apple

*Wall Tones has an In-App Purchase – for $0.99 USD.  Using the app is COMPLETELY free to try out, you can get to know the app and see if you like it.  The In-App Purchase does not come up until you try to export a color or gradient as a wallpaper.  This is a ONE-TIME purchase!  After purchase is completed – you can export AS MANY wallpapers as you would like.*

This update improves a bunch of features of the app: 

- Gradients can now contain more than 2 colors
- Gradients and colors can now be previewed, full screen
- Context menus for colors and gradients now have more options
- Gradients, when exported, are much smoother - no longer appearing stepped

I hope you love it!

[FREE] The Storyteller - Artificial Intelligence Powered Voice Actors,"This is my latest application using Artificial Intelligence. I always needed voice actors for YouTube videos, but there were no real options other than to pay someone on Fiverr to do so. Until now!

In short, AI matches the pitch of the previous word to the current word via spectrogram. This ensures a smooth flow between words making it sound like a real human.

Available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-storyteller-ai-tts/id1543117308) FREE

[Watch my demo video!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKHLmK-Mhec&amp;feature=youtu.be)

Create invigorating stories using different voice actors. Artificial Intelligence will make your story flow smooth, seemless, and coherent. Save your stories to listen to them anytime.

Read back anything (TTS)

If you don't want to read that article, or need a narration for any reason; use the read back function. You may select from a series of voice actors and download the audio in an mp3 format.

Included FREE are 6 amazing voice actors that will create amazing stories by talking to each other. One even speaks Spanish! Download more amazing voice actors for that perfect speech.

One free page of TTS a day (3000 characters). Purchase more for the lowest prices online!

This app is perfect for YouTube VoiceOvers, Business Commercials, or anyone who would like a Voice Actor for any reason. Create amazing conversations between voice actors and save them to listen anytime.

Someone asked me in another thread, how does this compare to pricing of professional voice actors? Well, its almost a quarter of a percent to what they charge! To hire a professional voice actor to read Tolstoy's *War and Peace,* you would be looking at a cool $20,000. With The Storyteller, you can get away for less than $60! My prices closely reflect what I pay to run the Artificial Intelligence services. It doesn't get better than that!

Apple Playlists Plus - A better way to discover new playlists,"Hi guys,

I made this website/app: https://apple-playlists-plus.gawlk.workers.dev/

Which helps you discover new playlists based on an artist, a song, a genre or even words. Because let's face it, finding new playlists on Apple Music can be quite frustrating.

The current database is still quite small with around 30k playlists but I have a raspberry that is constantly fetching data from Apple servers and pushing it to a database. Every request made on the website is cached for 24 hours so don't worry if you don't see the numbers going up immediately.

For those interested the project is made with Vue JS 3, Tailwind CSS, Cloudflare Workers for hosting and caching, Fauna for the database and I use [Apple's Music API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi) to pump their data.

This project isn't exactly free for me, it costs me around 60 euros per month (Fauna being the biggest part of that), so if you want to help me (which a would really appreciate) here's a link: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/gawlk

Anyway, hope you'll like it 🎵

PS: I you want their is also a Spotify version but the database is even smaller: https://spotify-premium-playlists.gawlk.workers.dev/",apple

[AW] Translated my Digital Time complication app to 20 languages. If you want to see digital time on analog watch faces check it out,"Hi Reddit,

The app was made for those who like the looks of analog faces, but still prefer digital for reading time.

This week I updated my app with support for 20 languages among other changes.

Name: TimeGlance

App Store: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1531068181](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1531068181)

Price: $0.99 or for $1.99 you can get it in a bundle with 3 of my other watch apps

Main features:

Show digital time in the selected format, updating precisely every minute

Optionally it can show date in many formats in a second line

Standalone watch app, will work great even if you iPhone is not in range

Supports all watch faces and complication slots

&amp;#x200B;

Hope you like it, and please share any feedback you have.",apple

"I made a stupid app called EmojiScope - Your daily horoscope, in emoji form! Now it's available on the the App Store now (and it's free!)","Hey r/Apple,

My new app, EmojiScope generates a new emoji-based prediction made up of three emojis each day, just for you. EmojiScopes are totally open to interpretation and it's up to you to find their meaning or the story behind them. 

**App Store link**: https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/emojiscope/id1532843344#?platform=iphone

**App site:** https://emojiscope.app

**Why the hell did you make this?**

* EmojiScope began as my COVID-19 lockdown project after I began learning Swift and SwiftUI in May with the aim to build and launch my first app by the end of 2020.

* I liked the idea of making something new that could be fun to share with people and I didn't want to take things too seriously. My friends who've tested the app for me have been given some hilarious, or eerily accurate results.

I've got a a laundry list of features and updates planned and a lot of work ahead of me and I'll continue to update EmojiScope in future. 

I'd love to hear how accurate (or inaccurate) your EmojiScopes are, and all of the stories that go along with them.

Please try it out, I'm really interested in any feedback you've got, too!

Cheers,
Dave.",apple

"Rethinking language learning for all Apple Devices with Widgets, Complications, iCloud - Independent universal Japanese app - Kanji Time","TL;DR: Kanji Time is a new app I made to learn Japanese vocabulary and kanji on all Apple platforms from watchOS to iOS and macOS. 100% native Apple technologies. ⌚️ 📱 💻 

App Store: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1527539097](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1527539097)

Here is a quick demo highlighting the UI and key features: [https://twitter.com/adartem/status/1337860696630026240](https://twitter.com/adartem/status/1337860696630026240)

Now with iOS 14 ,I decided to extend Kanji Time to all platforms not only Apple Watch.

I think immersion is crucial for language learning. Therefore supporting all devices is very important. Especially with features like widgets you are always exposed to new vocabulary.

&amp;#x200B;

* Widgets and Complications: repeat words and kanji at glance of your watch or home screen
* Fully automatic sync across devices through iCloud
* Smart notifications taking your progress into consideration
* Fast UI and 2000+ kanji animations, SwiftUI, 0 third party dependencies (iOS with watch app only 25MB)
* No registration, no email, no tracking, no ads

It is made accessible for all kinds of difficulty levels has more than 10000 words to fit different learning styles. For beginner levels its completely free.

Update to existing users: Don’t worry all your existing progress will automatically port to the new version and sync with all devices. -Notifications are now reworked entirely

If Japanese is not your cup of *sencha*, I plan to provide other languages with this framework.

Any feedback ist highly welcome!",apple

Amazon presses for in-person voting for union election instead of mail-in ballots in the midst of a pandemic (Seattle Times),"[https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/amazon-presses-for-in-person-voting-for-unionization-election-in-the-midst-of-a-pandemic/](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/amazon-presses-for-in-person-voting-for-unionization-election-in-the-midst-of-a-pandemic/)

Amazon wants the upcoming unionization election at its Bessemer, Alabama, warehouse to be held in-person, arguing against National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) guidance to hold mail-in balloting in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.

The e-commerce giant late Thursday appealed the ruling by an NLRB hearing officer a week ago to allow roughly 6,000 workers to take seven weeks, starting Feb. 8, to cast their ballots by mail to be represented by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). Amazon argued in one of two filings that the agency’s pandemic-voting policy is flawed.",amazon

Amazon is supposedly banning QAnon merchandise; I mod a sub of Q critics/debunkers and we can help track down violations because we know all the jargon they might hide behind. How can we help Amazon eliminate these materials which incite violence?,"I saw that the New York Times just reported [Amazon is purging QAnon-related products from their site](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/11/business/amazon-qanon.html), given the QAnon Movement's role in the deadly attack on the US Capitol last week.

I'm one of the moderators of r/Qult_Headquarters, a sub for critiquing/debunking Q (not a supporter sub), and the folks there would know better than anyone else on Reddit what search terms to use (beyond just the obvious) to find Q materials.

The problem is, Amazon apparently made it harder for buyers/shoppers to report TOS-violating listings a few years ago. I assume just because letting buyers report things ties up staff time and cuts into profit margins. So if there's no big ""report this violating product"" button on Amazon's website, what's the best way to tell Amazon ""yo, you said you're getting rid of this, but I found it on your site""?

If anyone can advise, I can let our readers know the best way to assist Amazon in cleaning house.",amazon

Why Amazon Can’t Beat Shopify,"[**Why Amazon Can’t Beat Shopify**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2020/12/23/why-amazon-cant-beat-shopify/?sh=1d94d29b7d9d)

Dec 23, 2020,02:07pm EST by Peter Cohan

Two of the most basic questions in business are: Who is your customer? How will you keep your current customers buying from you?

These questions come to mind in considering Amazon [AMZN](https://www.forbes.com/companies/amazon) [-0.9%](https://www.forbes.com/companies/amazon) and its competition with Shopify. The answers to those questions are particularly challenging for Amazon.

If Amazon’s customer is the merchant who sells goods to consumers — which is the customer of its Marketplace business, then Amazon is losing ground to Shopify. That’s because Amazon keeps its eye on its most successful merchants and often introduces its own similar products — at a much lower price — to compete with the merchants.

Depending on the quality of Amazon’s version, that knockoff could be good for consumers and bad for the merchant.

By contrast, Shopify’s sole customer is the merchant, according to the [New York Times Magazine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/magazine/shopify.html). And merchants are leaving Amazon for Shopify.

Now, the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-competition-shopify-wayfair-allbirds-antitrust-11608235127?mod=hp_lead_pos5), reports that Amazon is seeking to neutralize Shopify.

Sadly for Amazon, the ambiguous definition of its customer means it can’t wipe out Shopify unless it stops using its market power to raise the fees it charges merchants while knocking off the products of its most successful third-party sellers.

Amazon’s Third Party Marketplace Business

Since 1999, when Amazon — whose stock had risen 69% in 2020 as of December 22 — first opened up its marketplace in 1999 to third-party sellers, 1.7 million of them have signed up — attracted to Amazon’s huge base of consumers, high sales volumes and its ability to fulfill orders.

Amazon’s Third-Party Marketplace enables third-party sellers to display their products and prices on Amazon’s website. Once a consumer places an order, Amazon handles the delivery and after-sales customer service.

Amazon charges merchants a high price for these services. A clothing merchant that lists an item on its Marketplace for $50 could cede as much as $20 of the proceeds to Amazon. How so? According to the Times, $8.50 worth of the proceeds go to Amazon’s sales commission, $6.50 to advertising, and about $5.00 to its delivery service — Fulfillment by Amazon — which stores, picks and packs the merchant’s inventory.

This has become an increasingly important business for Amazon. Between 2015 and 2019, revenue from the marketplace increased from 14.9% to 19.2% of Amazon’s total revenue, according to [MarketPlacePulse](https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/amazons-retail-business-is-now-just-50-of-the-companys-revenue).

The third-party seller services revenue grew faster than Amazon’s retail operations taking over a bigger share of total revenue. Third parties paid Amazon $53.7 billion in fees in 2019 — nearly 26% more than the year before. Indeed, by November, the Times estimated that 60% of “commercial activity” on Amazon came from third-party sellers.

In addition to giving up some 40% of their revenues, third-parties cede to Amazon strategic assets that could endanger their survival. By far the most important of these is the third party’s relationship with the consumers who purchase their goods.

Merchants have little brand recognition and weak bargaining power against Amazon. For example, Amazon ships the third party products in its own envelopes or boxes, highlights rival vendors on its site, and extracts extra fees for early reviews and dedicated account managers, noted the Times.

Moreover, Amazon monitors and collects pricing data and until 2019, blocked merchants from offering their goods at a lower price outside of Amazon. The company told the Times its current policy is intended to prevent “practices that harm customer trust.”

How Do These Practices Threaten Third-Party Sellers?

If you’re wondering why this is a bad deal for merchants, consider the case of Pirate Trading. According to the Journal, around 2010 Pirate’s owner Dalen Thomas said that his company sold over $3.5 million worth of its Ravelli-brand camera tripods on Amazon.

In 2011, Amazon launched competing products under its AmazonBasics label. Specifically, Thomas said that Amazon launched its own versions of six of its most popular tripods. He ordered one of the Amazon tripods and found that it employed Pirate Trading’s design, had the same components, and used the same manufacturer, according to the Journal.

Thomas decided it was time to exit the tripod business. How so? Amazon set its price for the tripod clone below what Thomas paid his manufacturer to make Pirate’s version.

He decided to exit the business when he calculated that it would be less profitable for Pirate to pay its manufacturer to make its tripod than to buy Amazon’s clone, repackage and resell it, according to the Journal.

Amazon cited authenticity issues as the reason it stopped selling the Pirate Trading tripods that competed with AmazonBasic’s clones. In 2015, Thomas said, Amazon suspended all Ravelli products. Amazon told the Journal that “AmazonBasics tripods don’t violate any intellectual-property rights.”

What Propels Shopify’s Growth

Stories like this create an opening for services aimed at merchants that don’t want to suffer Pirate Trading’s fate.

That’s where Ottawa, Ontario-based Shopify comes in. It’s clearly doing something right. Since going public in May 2015, Shopify shares have risen 42.7-fold to $1,237 apiece and they’ve outgrown Amazon stock so far in 2020 — rising 203%.

About a million small- and medium-size businesses pay Shopify $29 a month for the basic software plus a [2.9%](https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/202012232476/etsy-and-shopify-buoyed-as-covid-19-boosts-online-sales) per-transaction credit-card processing fee. 7,100 Shopify merchants pay thousands of dollars a month to subscribe to Shopify Plus — a customizable version that makes up a quarter of Shopify’s monthly recurring revenue, according to the Times.

Shopify has been expanding its so-called back office services —including logistics, shipping and fulfillment. In 2019, it launched Shopify Fulfillment Network by partnering with “seven existing third-party logistics providers” and upgrading their computing resources to work with the Shopify platform.

Shopify revenue has grown rapidly. In the third quarter of 2020, Shopify's revenue nearly doubled to $767.4 million — $104 million more than analysts had been expecting, according to [DowJones](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20201029398/shopify-revenue-nearly-doubles-as-company-benefits-from-e-commerce-wave-amid-pandemic).

With a 109% increase in gross merchandise volume to $30.9 billion, $522.1 million worth of that revenue came from its merchant-solutions while $245.3 million came from subscription revenue driven by new merchants joining the service, noted DowJones.

Success in e-commerce demands three skills:

* Marketing to get customers to the online store;
* Software to take payments, place orders, and monitor shipping; and
* Manufacturing, warehousing; and shipping to deliver the goods to the destination specified by the customer.

Shopify does not handle the marketing — which means that the merchant maintains control over the customer relationship. Shopify does provide the software and services for storage and fulfillment. If a merchant sells a product for $10 on a Shopify store, they pay 59 cents for payment processing and “maybe a few dollars more for storage and fulfillment,” according to the Times.

If a merchant is good at designing a product that customers want and marketing it effectively, Shopify is a better platform. Otherwise, merchants are willing to give up more to Amazon — which provides both marketing, store operations, and order fulfillment.

If you excel at either of two ways to reach e-commerce customers, Shopify could be a great partner for a merchant.

One way to reach consumers — particularly members of Gen Z and millennials — is to be an Instagram or Snapchat influencer. The Times reported that 86% of these generations would gladly post content for money and 54% would be social media influencers.

A case in point is Kylie Jenner who has turned her existing social media audiences into a “billion-dollar e-commerce businesses seemingly overnight.” Consumers are eager to pay for such brands as long as they confer the magic feeling of being linked to a celebrity.

Another way to market is to buy ads on social media. While that strategy worked well between 2015 and 2019, it has become too expensive for all but the most differentiated consumer brands.

As the Times noted, in the recent past, a merchant operating on Shopify could pocket a $50 profit on a sweater it sold to consumers for $80. The merchant would pay $15 to manufacture it and another $15 to market it on Facebook.

By 2020, Facebook had raised its advertising rates to $75 — turning that $50 profit into a loss. Facebook also wiped out the profits for brands that could keep their customer acquisition costs under control. As the Times wrote, when such brands boosted their Facebook spending from $500 to $5,000, they lost money because the audience they were targeting remained about the same size.

Can Amazon’s Project Santos Nullify Shopify?

Despite the challenges of succeeding as a Shopify merchant, enough of them are growing to have put Shopify ahead of Amazon’s third-party business. How so? The Journal reported that over Black Friday weekend, Shopify’s small retailers sold $5.1 billion worth of merchandise — surpassing Amazon’s third-party sellers by $300 million.

While Amazon has dismissed its significance for years, in the past 12 months Shopify has been winning more of Amazon’s merchant customers. The reason? Amazon’s commissions have increased from 19% of sales in 2015 to 30%, according to the Institute for Local Self-Reliance.

The Journal reported that Amazon has created a “top-secret task force” dedicated to studying and copying parts of Shopify. Amazon appointed Peter Larsen, its vice president, consumer, to lead the initiative — dubbed Project Santos. In October, Larsen’s team presented its findings to CEO Jeff Bezos who was enthusiastic about the prospects for stemming merchant defections to Shopify.

Will Amazon wipe out Shopify? One canary in the coal mine is Shopify customer, Allbirds — a maker of “popular shoes using natural and recycled materials,” according to the Journal.

People who buy shoes from Allbirds are doing more than protecting their feet. As the Times wrote, they are making a statement to themselves and the world that they are “card-carrying member(s) of the technorati.”

In theory there are two ways to compete in an industry: be a differentiator in which you offer consumers more value for which they are willing to pay a price premium — or be a low cost producer — providing consumers a decent product at a much lower price.

Allbirds sees itself as a differentiator. Joey Zwillinger, Allbirds’s co-founder and co-CEO, told the Times that the company will not sell on Amazon or Foot Locker [FL](https://www.forbes.com/companies/foot-locker) [-0.1%](https://www.forbes.com/companies/foot-locker) because that would damage “its brand and pricing power.”

Zwillinger sees Amazon as a low cost producer. “Amazon is designed to commoditize products to the lowest common denominator of what they stand for. They would love to devolve us into a feature-and-benefit set and then put every knockoff in the world next to us, and then just drive everybody down to the lowest price, even if you’re sacrificing quality,” he told the Times.

That is what Amazon did to Allbirds. In 2019, the Journal reported, Amazon launched the Galen — a shoe the looks the same as the Allbirds’ bestseller, lacks the environmentally friendly materials, and is priced over 50% below the Allbirds shoe.

An Amazon spokesman told the Journal that its Galen shoe “didn’t infringe on Allbirds’ design” and that “offering products inspired by the trends to which customers are responding is a common practice across the retail industry.”

What Amazon did to Allbirds makes it clear that it is not keen on allowing its most successful third-party merchants to survive.

Amazon delights in using merchants as an R&amp;D outlet that helps identify successful products that it can clone and sell at huge discounts. If Amazon’s consumers lap up its merchant knockoffs and the merchant does not survive, so be it.

If consumers flock from the Allbirds’s $95 shoe to the $45 Amazon knockoff, then Allbirds is in trouble — and if such Shopify merchants are similarly targeted by Amazon’s low cost producer strategy, then Shopify is in trouble.

Are there enough consumers willing to pay a price premium for Allbirds’s shoes? If so, Allbirds should be fine.

As [*Geekwire*](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/weve-wearing-amazons-allbirds-lookalikes-compare-real-thing/) wrote in November 2019, “You get what you pay for. If you want better materials, the brand name, and care more about sustainability, the Allbirds are for you. If you really just want that wool look, don’t want to spend an extra $50, and don’t mind some minor flaws, Amazon 206 Collectives are the way to go.”

Shopify’s customer is the merchant, Amazon’s is the consumer. The corollary is that Amazon will continue its shabby treatment of its third-party sellers. Therefore Shopify will keep growing faster than Amazon.",amazon

I told her that i purchased it 30 days ago from a local store and she said not to worry, it's covered by manufacturers warranty so she will send me one out the next day.

Received the item but there is no returns label inside. Nor is there any correspondence via email or on my Amazon account referencing to me returning the faulty item.

I'm thinking that they are not going to want this old one back otherwise there would of been a returns label sent. 🤔",amazon

A few days later, the account was locked; first asking to verify the billing address on the account, and then the account specialists spilt the tea on the gift card. 

We provided receipts for the gift card purchase, and an email from her friend, no luck.

I know this shit happens everywhere around the world but it's just a shock when it happens to you, from someone in the building you live in. 

I have not come across any thugs or characters that I would expect to be thieves. Everyone is so warm, friendly, laid back. So I don't know who would do this. There was nothing valuable in the parcel, just a couple cheap computer cables and a cheap hat. Jokes on them I guess. But yeah, man. This feeling... Wish I could wash it off.",amazon

Including image in reply to bad review?,"Hello!

I am replying to a salty Google review of our business and want to add an image in some way in our reply. Is this possible? Are there any formats that a jpeg can be converted to be pasted in a reply? 

I will add some context here and maybe get some help on this issue as well! We had a potential client to our law firm write a one-star review claiming he never received a call back from an attorney (he actually did). I sent him a screenshot of our call log showing the call made to him (this is what I would like to include in our reply) and asked him to edit or update his review in light of this new information. He did update his review...with even more untruths! I've reached out to Google to review the post. Since they don't look at supporting documentation from business owners it was determined that the post met their TOS even though it can be proven that it does not reflect a 'genuine experience.'

Thanks for any insights y'all can share!",google

Google corrupted my data,"Long story short. Or maybe, not so short. I'm super unfortunately back to using Android. Not that I ever used it all that much ever to begin with. No. Just had an HTC loaded with whatever Android OS was out there in 2011... Had a love / hate relationship with it. 
I rocked different WINDOWS PHONEs from 2013-2020 (L.I.P). And I was a MUCH happier man for it!

But alas, MSFT ""lost"" to gooble's dominance of the ""app world."" - __-

Anyway, I would have loved to keep using my Lumia 950 til the end of time, sans apps, and sans gooble's crap code, but, the battery would only last about a day. :D Seriously though, it would, just about. But I like not having to charge my phone for a couple days.

So anyhow, back to the subject of this post. I'm back to being subjected to gooble domination. My existence has become bleak. Using the most invasive of all code. It is such a $hi++y OS! I mean, I understand gooble could never code the way MSFT can, but this Android 10 OS is absolute refuse!!! And I'm not even referring to the hundreds of hidden suboptions where gooble tries to ravage your privacy and info (yeah, like that instance where you get a notification offering to scan your messages for scam and you hit dismiss and gooble enables said scanning of 'potential scam' feature anyway, yeah).

I can't even stick to the subject of this post! I've got so much venting to do!

But back to the subject... I mounted a SanDisk MicroSD card. TOP-OF-THE-LINE. Same card I used flawlessly in the 950. Of course, Android wouldn't have it. I had to reformat it to retro-a$$ exFat file system. Good luck on seeking guidance from gooble on what file system your MicroSD card MUST be formatted to. Seriously, search for it. It's like a myth. exFat, Fat32, WOMBO? gooble certainly won't tell you in any official capacity.

So I reformat, remount, and I choose ""Expand phone storage."" Whatever that first option is. Okay. Nice. But why wouldn't I ever be prompted to save stuff to the MicroSD card???... Where was the MicroSD card? Not even my camera had the option to utilize it in settings... Came to find out the hard way, I should have actually selected "" Use MicroSD card as portable storage."" Perfect wording, gooble! Makes total sense!

 After endlessly going though every single option in the Android OS to find a way to make use of my unused MicroSD card, I saw an option ""Migrate data to MicroSD card."" ""Awesome!,"" thought I... Oh boy... That's really when the Android OS took a steaming pile of poo in my hands!

The ""process"" completed ""successfully,"" according to gooble's super intuitive code! With one caveat of course. All the data was actually never migrated. I confirmed this via Computer Management on Windows, when the MicroSD card had been formatted and appropriated in a super weird way by the Android 10 OS and I couldn't access any contents with Explorer but could see the MicroSD card was pretty much all free space... (unavoidable run-on, read it quickly, it'll make sense) 

Also, upon physically removing the MicroSD card from the Android 10 phone, all the files ""remained present."" But of course, remained all corrupt.

So what did that process of ""Migrate data to SD card do?"" Well. Just entirely corrupt every piece of user stored data on my phone is all. Nothing else really.

And before I get a slew of ""You did it wrong!"" ""Your MicroSD card was corrupt to begin with! "" ""You had been watching porn, and a virus merely laid dormant and exactly when you exacted the migrating process that virus messed your stuff up, BRO!""
I'll have you know I've worked professionally as a tech at a top-tier University level and Professional level for over 5 years.

The phone was just freshly restarted. The SanDisk MicroSD card is certainly not to blame. Reformatted it anew and using it now with zero issues. I would never expect anything but pure reliability from SanDisk memory. I actually did not utilize the phone at all during the process. Put it to charge. Even closed out the 2 apps that were running. So. Purely just good ole' gooble crap code.

I did some searches to see if anyone shared this experivme and I didn't really find anything. I hope this post serves to confirm the sanity of any other poor soul who experiences this madness, and my ultimate hope is that this makes it to some GOOGLE ""support team"" and they realize that perhaps they should have MSFT on their payroll in a larger capacity because this kind of occurrence is completely unacceptable! I happened to land on some gooble support page where gooble's support response to a situation like mine was something along the lines of ""If this happens to you, send us some feedback, we may look into it."" NOICE, Google, NOICE!

What was worse, is that my phone remained ""in a trance."" Every picture and video I took afterward also became corrupt. Every thing I downloaded become corrupt. It was only after I started tinkering with every single Android OS storage component (clearing caches and storages, respectively) that I was able to save 'stuff' to the phone again without the files becoming or being corrupted...

This isn't really any plea for help. Admittedly, almost entirely a rant, really. There was nothing I could have done to avoid this. Clearly a case of faulty code. I mean. I remember reading at some point later when the Android OS was reformatting the MicroSD card for portable storage something along the lines of ""Wait while your SD card is being formatting."" Being formatting? Check it out for yourself! That's what was written. If that kind of grammatical mistake makes its way through, what else does too? Umm. I'll tell you. $hi++y code!

No idea what actually went wrong. I'd have to be able to code and have access to proprietary Andorid OS code to examine it... Someone out there can find the faults, I'm sure. Clearly, as anyone can tell, I am NOT an Android, nor a Google fan! I wanted to dislike this phone. After all, I was forced to downgrade to this OS. But wow. It really gave me another reason not to like it! 

Direct message to google: Stop pushing the illusion that you are a ""software"" company. Stick to your search engine, ravaging everyone's privacy and data, and pumping the internet full of ads based off all the data you aggregate from anyone who makes the mistake of ever utilizing any ""service"" you provide. That's what you do best. And, oh yeah, fix this garbage OS which can't even execute the most rudimentary of tasks! Haven't you been ""working on it"" since 2010???

Google Customer Service is ATROCIOUS. Shipped a week old Pixel 4a5G back to Google due to device failure and now they're saying it has a cracked screen?!?! Won't offer any sort of assistance.," So I purchased 2 new pixel 4a 5g's for me and my girlfriend through T-Mobile. Device 1 craps out on me after little more than a week, just won't turn on. I'm upset because this is the second pixel phone that I've owned to have this same issue but whatever, I'll mail it back, it's under warranty. I ship the phone back with the RMA in the exact google box it came in and then place that box in a FEDEX package with shipping paper. Google comes back and says it has a cracked screen and will cost me $149 plus tax??? Google is telling me I'm S.O.L. and I need to pay up or beat it. My girlfriend is unemployed due to COVID and this was a luxury purchase as it is, and now this. Google is acting like a bunch of heartless corporate heathens, I'm so disappointed.

Backups on google drive expire,"In November, I had my backup on google drive because I reset to factory settings my phone. I erase all data on this phone.

I also read that if device is setup to back up fairly frequently, the back ups never expire, so I enabled back up on the settings of this phone on ""google back up"" but  for about 6 hours later, I disabled back up. I change my mind that I don't want to back up. And on the next day it says, ""back up expires in 0 days."" And on Yesterday, I didn't check the expiration.

I checked today, and all my backups are remove on my google drive. There are no warnings about expiration on backup I made on November anymore. It's says now ""your device is not backed up.""

Sorry for a long post. I am curious on how my backup is expired, but I am using my phone and it is active.",google

Is there a way to specify the search and replace to be ""men"" (or any other word) as a standalone word, instead of highlight other words like ""department"" because m-e-n are in that word?

Google shopping is utterly worthless,"I just tried to order some masks and was spammed by search results from wish. And I COULDN'T FILTER THEM.

What makes those ~~imbeciles~~ nice and competent people think that I want to buy a product that has shipping times betwenn a month and a millenium and probably is made from asbestos and rat poison?

Wish aside, removing a store from search results is such a natural option. You might have had bad experiences in the past and just want to remove a store because of that. But no, we can't. We can only chose specific stores, which is just ~~dumb~~ great, because THAT might filter out other relevant stores.

I feel like everything is designed to make you spend a long time searching just to give in and buy a more expensive product from the ""relevant results"" page.

Google is considering to completely pull out of Search services in Australia,"Because of the Australian Media news bargaining code, Google is reportedly completely pulling the search engine out of australia. This would impact not just australia, but possibly other countries as well. The Australian government wants google to pay news companies for google recommending their content. Google tells shows users the best possible website that matches their search. So, if you search dogs, google finds the best websites about dogs.   


If you search for “News” like ‘Coronavirus’ then google finds the best websites that have news about coronavirus. Googles does not show you the actual news articles, but the Australian government wants to introduce a law that makes google pay news companies, just for showing google users the news websites **link**. **Not** the actual **content of that news.**

Wait,  you have to click on basically every single pic and vid to be able to download it?!! There's no way to drag and select a whole bunch?!""

I find out the only way to download all of them is what's called ""Takeout"" and it takes days, they send you and email to download zip files that are all just a mess.

Then today I get an email again asking to free up space. It gives me a link that says ""free up large videos and photos"" and it's got my longest videos all ready and organized. But you can only delete them!!! So the system can gather the large pics and vids, just not to be able to download them.

Getting targeted ads for literally whatever I am typing.,"So as far as I know, targeted ads happen when you browse something and its cookies get stored. Recently I tried searching about ""dell laptops"" on incognito mode in chrome. Still I got targeted ads on Instagram. Do incognito mode also store cookies ?

Next I started noticing ads attentively. To test it I just sent a message on whatsapp to my friend about ""Cadbury dairy milk"" and to my surprise 5 seconds later when I opened a random site, I saw ad for it. Now either WhatsApp is culprit or my keystrokes are getting tapped. I am using gboard. I think whenever I use words that gboard suggest me, I get an ad for that particular thing. Is it possible gboard using my keystrokes to generate ad ? I have Malwarebytes installed on my android and its scan is always clean.

Now this thing is really getting on my nerves. What could be the possible reason behind such targeted ads ? What can I do about it ? I am currently using a Xiaomi device.",google

we have a large number of followers and we also have a large amount of video some of these have over four million views.

It looks like you have added a further strike to our channel for a video that has been uploaded some nine months ago and had this been the case our account would not have had any valued strike on the account can you please review you reasons we feel your reasoning is unfair as you clearly state if you breach any of the community guidelines we have now had time to read through these and totally understand these and if refer to there in future when we post a video to your platform.

we would be happy to remove the offending video. that has not bee uploaded since you issued a warning about the incorrect title of a video due to myself being dyslexia. We have held a channel on your platform for a number of years we supply video fo breaking news to the Sun The Daily Mail, the Mirror,Sky and ITN to say a few. We really want to repair our good working relationship with you can you please review the requests on our account. The inspection how long will that stay in place for and can we access the video already uploaded on to the channel las some of these releases to the passing people who send off we have filmed etc and due to the suspension family and relatives are unable to access these video

Google Docs predictive formatting is completely broken,"I've been trying to use Google Docs for basic composition for a few months. I can now confidently say that Docs utterly fails as a basic word processor. 

The core of the problem is that Docs believes it's smarter than the user. There is no way to turn off its predictive formatting, which means that Docs will randomly change your formatting preferences on the fly with no warning. 

As an example:  auto-indenting. I'm a classically trained typist, so I hit Tab for indent. It's part of my routine. I do not use auto-indent. However, there is NO WAY TO PREVENT DOCS FROM AUTO-INDENTING. [Every](https://support.google.com/docs/thread/4663804?hl=en) [official](https://support.google.com/docs/thread/18478892?hl=en) [solution](https://support.google.com/docs/thread/19701498?hl=en) is wrong. Setting Normal Text and default styles **only works for a few paragraphs** (a few pages, maximum) before Docs reverts back to auto-indenting. Conversations with Google Support [can quickly become surreal comedies](https://support.google.com/docs/thread/87329963?hl=en). 

What's even more insane is that the predictive formatting can go completely rampant if you're not there to correct its constant mistakes. For example, if you're typing without looking at the screen (transcribing handwritten notes, for example), the auto-indent can start to progressively drift to the right. I looked up from one transcription to find that Docs had increased the indent every few paragraphs until it was at the 5"" mark. Absolutely ludicrous. 

I've recreated this behavior across multiple accounts, multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge), and multiple OSes (Windows, Linux, and Chrome OS). You can easily recreate it yourself by transcribing any decently lengthy document. 

tl;dr - Google Docs is utterly useless for composition.",google

The Google Pay app is the worst product ever made by a FAANG company,"I cannot believe how awful this product is. It's a payment app that you cannot use to pay people. Is Google Pay just supposed to be a bank? Am I crazy? I cannot pay people by their email address like I could on desktop. I click ""pay friend or group"" type an email address in and it says no results even though this person has paid me on google pay several times. I then see the person inviteable on the home screen and when I go to invite them (which I shouldn't because they already have Gpay) it pops up the jankiest email copy I've ever seen (it says ""supply is limited"" that's so stupid it's an app not a Best Buy on PS5 release day).

Maybe the ellipses icon on the top right will let me do something to fix the situation! Oh nope, it just has a section for sending feedback. I've sent tons.

Maybe clicking on my previous transaction with the person I'm trying to pay will let me pay them again? Nope. I can literally see the person I want to pay in my history and cannot find a way to pay them.

On cashapp and venmo you just type someones name in, and pay them! Works great! On Google Pay I'm a user dying to pay someone through their product and can't. Terrible.

But on the plus side, there's 2 tabs where you can go and buy shit that Google makes money on. So that's great. If I ever am in the mood for REI while I'm using my payment app I'll totally click that stupid ass offer.

The V in MVP stands for Viable. A payment app that doesn't pay isn't viable for anything.",google

Floor and unit screwing up search in maps,"Hi guys, I'm sure someone has answered this but I wasn't able to find relevant posts through searching on Google as well as reddit, so here goes. 

Google Contacts has two address lines that I can fill out, which I presumed one line would not be included in search when linking to Maps for things like floor number and unit number. However, it appears both lines are included as search text. This happens both when I tap on the address in my address book and when I search for the contact in Maps itself and tap on the contact. And this is consistent both on Android and on the web version. 

What I'm asking is, Is there any way I can enter the floor and unit in the address fields and still have Maps be able to search for the address without those floor and units messing up the search? Thanks in advance!",google

Frustrated with bug bounty reporting...,"Came here to vent a bit... This is the second time I've tried to report an issue using their bug bounty program, and twice I've been told it isn't an abusable issue when it really is for them... I think the issue is that it is a very DIFFERENT kind of problem.

If you are a google fi subscriber, you have another google store front-end you can use. Here you can order a new phone, add a trade-in kit for that new phone, or oder a free data-only sim card.

The issue is that if you add a phone to your cart, and add a trade-in kit, you can go back to the main front-end, and with the trade-in kit still in your basket, check-out the free data only sim card.

While it doesn't display it in the prompt or order confirmation, they still ship you the trade-in kit, and I assume will still issue credits for it, when nothing is actually spent on their store (have yet to test, but have two lovely trade-in boxes from testing this out).

This is a dual issue... Nothing is stopping people from using this to fence a bunch of stolen phones... And google is paying for all these shipping labels for not getting anything in return.

I documented all of this twice to them in a bug bounty report (once last year, again in the last couple days) and both times wrote the issue off as a non-threat. This is still a threat, it just isn't a typical data leak or vulnerability.
  
Well I tried. I hope posting here will get this issue seen by the right people so it can be recognized as the problem it actually is, get fixed, and that I get paid out as their program warrants.

Google review not showing,"Hi,

I had a terrible experience with my previous apartment complex. Tried to work out some things with them before moving out but they just stressed me out way more than I already was. My only way to at least get them back for what they put us through is to leave my experience online. For some reason google is not posting my review. Does anyone know why? I’ll leave my review below if anyone cares to read it:

Lived here for a little over 2 years and had issues since day 1.

I'll list some of the Pro's and Con's I saw and then I'll post my experience.

Overall - I wouldn't live here again. I would pay a little bit extra for a better complex if I had to rent in uptown again.

PROs:

1. Cheap rent per sq footage.

2. Semi-decent area in Uptown.

3. Decent gym area.

CONs:

1. They don't work with the city for trash so the trash rooms are always full of used mattresses and other large stuff as there is no pick up day for big items. Homeless people sometimes sleep in those rooms during winter. (I don't blame them)

2. BBQ Grills were constantly out of gas and out of order most of the time.

3. I heard a girl screaming late one night about her abusive boyfriend trying to beat her or something. My sister was visiting so I couldn't open the door to help. I immediately called their security team but they said they don't do that and I needed to call 911 which I did. So 1. The security team is a joke. 2. I learned they started renting out some apartments as AIRBBs which explained some sketchy residents and those incidents.

4. Multiple break ins. A neighbor got his car window smashed and other neighbors got their apartments broken into. A LOT of packages got stolen from your door. They do have lockers now cause it was a BIG issue. Good luck if your package is left at your door.

5. The management team is not your friend. We had a GREAT relationship with the management team in our previous complex to the point we bought them Christmas presents every year. The management team here is courteous but being polite doesn't solve problems and we had a lot of those.

6. They operate like a low cost airline, so check your contract. Most recently there is a really high mandatory fee for cleaning after your move out, and believe me that's not the only thing they will charge. You WILL get squeezed.

As for my personal experience here..

1. Signed with LINCOLN April 2018 we signed a free month and a referral amt, two days after we moved in they changed to CREA. We went to see them about our rent and FOBs, etc. They were all over the place as they had just started working there so we told them not to worry and that we were coming back next week to talk about it. They sent us an eviction letter not 1 week of us living there. They said there was a prorated amount we didn't know about that we had to pay before our free month which apparently they couldn't tell us when we went ask, or call us to discuss.

2. They ""lost"" the paperwork we signed with LINCOLN so they didn't honor the referral bonus.

3. I've never had a late payment in my life. Had an issue setting the autopay on their website, I went to ask for help but they wouldn't help, not only did they charge me for not setting it up correctly the first time but they blocked it and were making me drive from Plano to uptown to get cashiers checks. I was really frustrated at that point so I looked at their corporate website and looked for a VPs phone number. I called her and the issue was solved the next day. Never had a late payment with them either.

4. Team is friendly but only issue that was resolved for me was a FOB that wasn't working which I believe they charged me for. Not much critical thinking on their end. You are on your own.

5. My roommate and myself were out a lot travelling for work. We didn't mistreat the apartment in any way. We paid a company to pick up big trash items and donated our washer and dryer so we didn't leave trash like other people do. They are now trying to charge abusive amounts like claiming damage to a desk that was never used and which they again conveniently lost our inventory list from the contract I signed with Lincoln.

I talked to them about working with us to pay a fair amount but again, useless. When I went there they mistakenly opened a different bill I guess from another unhappy tenant and they were charging other ridiculous amounts.

Bad first impression, bad last impression. There were 5 friends living there originally, there is only 1 left.",google

Google vs Microsoft vs Cisco vs the rest," Thrilled to launch the collaboration tools comparison chart.  


In here, we started to compare the major chat and messaging features but soon realised the entire collaboration experience has to be included.  


David Maldow had already created the video conferencing matrix ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_\_zWyUMQ9SY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__zWyUMQ9SY)) so the purpose of this chart was to add in often overlooked messaging and collaboration complexities faced when evaluating new or additional tools that can appear without IT or procurement sign-off.  


Included:  


🌟 Basic chat and messaging features  
🌟 High-level security detail  
🌟 Notification management  
🌟 Guest access  
🌟 Integrations  
🌟 Messaging interoperability  
🌟 Freemium pricing  


As always, feedback welcomed and I hope it proves useful.

Finally got the Dispatched email last night January 10th. 48 days since I placed my order.

I think my days with Google are coming to an end,"I have truly never felt like more of a number or a minuscule cog in Google's wheel than I do these days dealing with Google Support.  My account has been broken for over a month and I am not able to make purchases via any Google service (YouTube TV, Google Play, Google One) that uses my Google Pay profile. Purchasing hardwood from Google Store works though. I, of course, foolishly purchased Pixel Buds two weeks ago and now I am ready to throw just about Google product in the trash and never give them another dollar of mine.

Does anyone know how to talk to someone at Google Support that actually has the ability to solve problems?  The person I just spoke to gave me the ""reading from a script"" run-around and told me I wasn't able to actually speak to a specialist.  I was assured an engineer was looking into my issue.  This has been going on for a month now.  Chatting over and over with their various support departments never leads to any results and getting this issue escalated to someone with the ability to resolve the issue doesn't seem to be happening.

Google Asking for ID/Credit Card age verification for 14 year old account.,"So a friend of mine just now got a request to verify that they are above the age of 18; even though they've had their Google account for **fourteen full years.** 

They would've had to make their Google account when they were younger than 4 to not be 18 or older now. 

[They got this notice when trying to watch an age-restricted YouTube video that they'd watched fine just days prior.](https://preview.redd.it/fkri0fmlr7a61.jpg?width=581&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6d30897f5493e8ec9e11e7743454372a6c3f680)

This however leads to a larger question - How long has Google been doing this? On a quick search; the earliest mention we could find of this measure is [December 3rd.](https://piunikaweb.com/2020/12/03/some-youtube-users-aerated-by-age-verification-request-on-certain-videos/)

This measure seems incredibly over-reaching, especially for an account of this age and I think raises even more concerns about user data, privacy, etc. Have you encountered this? What do you make of this?

Facebook has been doing it for longer; but I'd not heard of Google doing this until now. Good thing is you can avoid a lot of Google services and many don't need you to be verified 18+, but YouTube is one of the few services you just cannot avoid.",google

"google, please bring back play music","i live in Mozambique a very  poor country therefore companies like Spotify and google don't feel an incentive to make their products available here 

Netflix is one of the only western company that made their products available   and they have major success 

i loved play music, the idea of me being able to download music from  chrome and listening to it whenever i want 

google doesn't allow subscriptions and streaming in Mozambique but i did not really care since i wouldn't subscribe anyway 

google killed play music which really messes me up because yt music was not available in my country 

i used a free vpn and installed the app

long story short you need a subscription to just download music

c'mon google. this move was very greedy

"With the introduction of Google Voice, there's now five different websites that all do essentially the same thing.","With the addition of Google Voice, we now have at least five different websites to jump between to communicate. Each of these different ""services"" are all essentially reskins of the same idea: communicate with people. Instead of making the decision of keeping them all in one interface, why does Google insist on spreading them across different UIs, with different websites, and different mobile apps? Here's the list if you were curious:

&amp;#x200B;

Gmail

Google Hangouts

Google Chat

Google Meet

Google Voice

&amp;#x200B;

These could all easily be under the same service, with different settings or options to get to each. Want to call someone? Give pop-up bubbles between video call, voice call, and VoIP. Want to send messages? Just add the functionalities from Google Chat to something like the hangouts interface in Gmail.

Google Sheets Question - Change History For Docs Not Owned,"Random question - in a group that has a shared google sheet that updates sporadically. I don't own the doc and don't really want to view the change history per se, but want to see how certain cells have been updating.

basically, we're all owners in this simulation and based on what we input, different people show up as 'winning' something; I want to see the history of one cell to see which owners have been leading/winning in that cell if that makes sense. If it doesn't, sorry, I'm fat.",google

Google X Bookmarks,"Can someone please tell me if any of the below is **incorrect**?  
There are only two services for managing bookmarks using a Google account:

1. Google Bookmarks  
Which can only be viewed/managed here: [www.google.com/bookmarks](https://www.google.com/bookmarks/)  
To add a bookmark, go to that URL and add (or add a ⭐ to a place within Maps?)   
Entries can have Notes or Labels (tags).  
They are organized/shown by Label (and can be sorted by title, label or date).  
Saved in my Google account.
2. Chrome Bookmarks:  
Which can be viewed/managed in Chrome (menu, top bar and Manager page)  
To add a bookmark, use the ⭐, or CTRL-D (in Chrome, of course).  
Entries have no metadata (only Title and URL).  
They are organized/shown by Folder (and can only be sorted by title).  
Can be synched using a Google Account, but essentially it's local

Although both these services are (or can be) associated with a same Google account, they are completely separate. A bookmark saved in one won't/can't be accessed in the other.

\---

Is all of the above correct? If so, is there a reason for having 2 similar services this way? Or is this service just being neglected?

I'd like to be able to save/access my bookmarks via Chrome, but organize/access them like in Google Bookmarks, via Labels (since tags are much more flexible than folders). Is this possible?

If not, any suggestions for an alternative service/system? I'd rather keep my bookmarks in Google, to avoid the trouble of moving them. If I need to move them, I'd rather never need to move them again in the future...",google

I accidentally purchased a '1 year of Nitro Classic' from discord and I can't seem to get a refund for it.,"Hello I accidentally purchased the Nitro classic from discord and I have no clue how to get a refund for it. 

I was talking a shower this morning as soon as I got up and once I was done and I got a direct message from my friend through discord. I was halfway done drying myself with a towel so I decided to answer him. Turns out my hands were still a little wet and it purchased the Nitro classic. I started laughing by surprise to how the ounce of water on my phone made the purchase but I was like whatever and I sent a refund ticket through google play as I was instructed to.

'Hi I know this sounds crazy but I was taking a shower and once I was done I was checking my dms. I had a little bit of water on top of my phone and somehow the ounce of water that was on my phone purchased this. May I please get a refund on this purchase? I accidentally bought this around 5 minutes ago. '

I got a reply rather quick saying that I was not going to be able to get a refund. I read over the policy they have for refunds ( it was in korean for me I think it is because I'm in Korea right now) and it was pretty clear to me that unwanted and accidental purchases were provided a refund if it was asked before 2 days (48 hours passed). 

I'm pretty sure a bot answered me because I sent a ticket in both korean and English and both of the replies were identical in English.

Can anyone help me out here?

TIL: Personal Gmail accounts can now use File Stream to sync Drive content as an alternative to Backup and Sync,"I have always thought that the File Stream application was exclusive for Gsuite (now Workspace) users, and would always be, but I came across an article by chance (in chromeunboxed and after in androidpolice) in which they explained that Google opened the use of this application to all users, so I just tested it and effectively works great with a gmail.com account!

Using this application has its pros and cons, but for me it is better

**Backup and Sync PROS:**

\- You can choose which folders you want to be synchronized (your desktop, the documents folder, an external hard drive ...)

\- You can choose that the pics and videos that are synchronized, go to Google Photos instead of being only in your Google Drive.

&amp;#x200B;

**File Stream PROS:**

\- You can choose which folders and files are synced locally. For example, if you have 200 Gb in your Google Drive, you can configure that only a folder of 20 Gb occupies space on your disk, and the rest remain accessible on demand.

\- You can easily access shared drives (if someone has a workspace shared drive with you)

\- Google Drive is configured as if it were a mounted hard disk, for some it is more comfortable that it is like that, than just one folder inside C:\\ in Windows

&amp;#x200B;

Without a doubt, good news that they have done this. What do you prefer? I hope this is useful for those who prefer this application, but thought they could not use it.

What I hope now is that they take the best of both applications and put it together in one.

&amp;#x200B;

Happy Holidays!

&amp;#x200B;

Ps: Sorry for the bad english, of course.",google

Idea for improvement for text messaging in android,"I'm a programmer and one of the things i really like in my IDE is custom templates. I type like jbe and it auto expands preformatted code with my cursor in all the places i need to customize. 

The same thing should happen in my text box with the ability to customize preformatted text. Like if i type addr space it should expand to my address. Or i might have a template like this:

""Hey, sorry I'm in a meeting will get back to you around [V-I1]"". Then you type in the custom code like meeti and space, and it expands with the cursor in the variable position for typing. Then you press space and it advances to the next variable. If the user navigates away the text just remains and can be edited like normal. 

This would be dope.",google

Salento: Vacanze nei villaggi turistici nel Salento," 

[VACANZE NEL SALENTO](https://preview.redd.it/gaxj9r8w3d761.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6579f2e438b56f5c37ea9462a2b5727994132f1e)

## Salento: Vacanze nei villaggi turistici nel Salento

Il barocco non si trova esclusivamente a Lecce. Così come il barocco non è “tutto” **il Salento.** L’equazione rovesciata nella semantica negativa induce ad alcune riflessioni. Essendo questa terra dove la pietra predomina, come ad esempio la pietra leccese, dunque. **Il Salento** non si può conoscere e penetrare se non si capisce che esso nelle sue forme di vita più alte e più umili è vincolato, nasce la pietra. Non è infatti un caso che il barocco prenda le mosse qui all’incirca un secolo più tardi in confronto al Bernini dell’altare in San Pietro a Roma o dall’altare dell’abside della basilica di S. Antonio a Padova. In genere gli insediamenti barocchi sulla costa, da **Gallipoli** a **Santa Cesarea Terme**, **Otranto** è ovviamente un caso a parte. Per convincersene basti dare uno sguardo ai graffiti situati sulle pareti della grotta e a una lastra di pietra rossa con effigie primitive. Parliamo naturalmente della **grotta Romanelli** che si estende anche alla geo-paleontologia. Dalla Romanelli alla ben più famosa **grotta Zinzulusa** il passo è più che breve. E’ ubicata nella zona di **Castro Marina**, a sud della Romanelli.  Al suo interno, che si apre su uno specchio di **mare** di color blu intenso, la grotta riserva sin dagli altissimi soffitti un sorprendente scenario di stalattiti e stalagmiti. Se il turista s’arma di pazienza in vacanza per visitare i posti più belli, come ad esempio spiagge di sabbia chilometriche, grotte, pinete, e soggiornare nei [**villaggi turistici nel Salento**](https://villaggiestivi.com/villaggi-in-puglia/) **con la propria famiglia** o **con gli amici** scoprirà un mondo diverso fatto di semplicità e tanto divertimento per le **vacanze estive**. Proprio per questo, [**Villaggi Estivi**](https://villaggiestivi.com/) vuole elencare alcuni zone più belle per trascorrere le **vacanze estive** con tariffe molto agevolate per tutta la famiglia con bambini, gruppi o amici che intendono vivere e godersi la **vacanza** con gli affetti più cari.

### GALLIPOLI

**Gallipoli** dopo un primo tratto di vegetazione particolarmente incline agli aranceti e gli agrumeti (la chiamano la piccola conca d’oro del Salento), da qui si possono agevolmente scorgere le due Gallipoli: la nuova, lasciati i **due mari** di Ponente e di Levante, invade il retroterra aggrappandosi alle falde della  “serra”, e la città  vecchia, romita all’orizzonte, è serrata in un recinto di mura e di memorie, di paure e silenzi, anticipati, le une e li altri, dal mastio circondato dal **mare cristallino** e da **spiagge incantevoli**. Risaliamo lungo il ponte e c’immergiamo nel dedalo delle viuzze di questa densissimo agglomerato marino. Lo percorriamo dall’esterno lungo una circonferenza che gli consegna mare da ogni lato e, anche, poco distante, **l’isola di Sant’Andrea**. Pian piano una lunga e ininterrotta serie di edifici si sono eretti davanti al mare e mano a mano che ci si avvicina al **Lido San Giovanni,** uno stabilimento balneare che ha fatto da portainsegna della massiva urbanizzazione. Dopo il Lido San Giovanni ci s’imbatte nella **Baia Verde**, un altro agglomerato residenziale con diverse [**case vacanze Salento**](https://villaggiestivi.com/villaggi-in-puglia/) a due passi un mare cristallino e battigia bianchissima.

### CASTRO

**Marina Marittima** si annuncia per l’infittirsi dei soliti villini balneari. Nel frattempo la vegetazione si va popolando di eucalipti. Castro appare una piccola Portofino, dalle grandi finestre come occhi pieni di colore corrispondenti alle bocche vuote delle grotte intente a ingoiare il mare. All’interno, lungo una serpentina, si sale fin verso **Castro**, un borgo medievale che gode un suggestivo panorama. Una meta estiva molto richiesta dalle famiglie per trascorrere le **vacanze** soprattutto con la **famiglia**, in quanto una cittadina molto tranquilla, con diversi locali e diverse discoteche per un **divertimento estivo** al top.

### TRICASE PORTO

Meno di 4 km dal ciglio della Serra sino alla costa adriatica. Verso T**ricase Porto** si accentua la geografia divisoria dei muri di pietra a secco, a ridosso fioriscono i cardi. Ci si inerpica sulla serra rocciosa. Nella discesa si infittiscono i parchi delle ville. Un viale di eucalipti ci conduce davanti al mare del porto turistico. La litoranea prende subito le distanze e si acquatta in basso ai piedi della scogliera, dalle terrazze e dei dirupi ieri deserti e carsici, oggi ordinati e illeggiadriti da una corolla di case e villini. Lunghi virgulti di agavi e canne nascondono spesso la visione del **mare cristallino** e posti veramente allo stato naturale, molto ideale per una **vacanza in pieno relax.**",google

Request for a 'report clickbait button',"Hey all, basically looking for your support, I've sent feedback too Google, will paste it below. I'm thinking this would be beneficial and if a lot of us request it, maybe it'll get some traction.

&gt;It'd be amazing to have a 'flag clickbait' button, users could raise the issue with news and filter it out if based on a percentage (e. g. if more than 70% of readers reported clickbait, don't show those stories - but we could choose the percentage ourselves). 
If these flags were visible to those posting, it may reduce the level to which papers spin the truth, much like having a fake news report button on Facebook reduces the temptation to exaggerate stories there.",google

Google non tech job interview,"Hi guys and gals, 
So I recently interviewed for a elec engineer role in Europe. And I wanted to share my experience as I was not able to find any good information on the interviews prior to my interview. 
So I was contacted by the recruiter (Day1)and he explained the process and the various interviews. As I was also interviewing for another company I did tell him I would like to  have all interviews as soon as possible and he was okay with it. So my first was a tech interview(Day7)
Didn't know the who would be interviewing me so was a bit curious. Spoke to a Googler and it was basic questions around my CV. Nothing out of the ordinary so thought went well.Day 9 spoke to the recruiter and he told me the feedback was positive and would like to invite me for the next set of interviews.

Day- 11-Scheduled another call with the recruiter where he walked me through the various interviews:GCA, RRK,RRK and Googliness and Leadership. Post this meeting I was scrambling on the web for info and saw some youtube videos on the various interviews. For the GCA I started even preparing for case interview questions and looking at McKinsey, bain and BCG websites.. 
Received an email from the scheduler who set up the 4 interviews for Day(15).
On the day of interviews I received an email stating the GCA cannot go ahead as the interviewer was not available but proceed with the other three.
So RRK- it was a technical round with specific questions on DCs. The interviewer was very experienced and we had a good discussion. Some I was not aware of and he was okay with it. 
Second RRK- this was more of an informal chat with the senior manager . Nice gentleman from the states just spoke about experience.  I was drained that this will be another tech round. 
G&amp;L- this was more on situational based questions. So anyone familiar with Star or CAR method would be able to answer these.
GCA- this was specific questions on situations and nothing like what were shown on the case interviews.  This was done by the hiring manager and he will decide if this goes to the hiring committee. As this is christmas period I now have to wait until 11th Jan to find out if i have been successful or not.
Hope this helps the non SWEs.
Thanks

"[Rant] Has anyone else got really exhausted with Google this year? Google Photos, Print, Play Music, Hangouts, Gdoc storage are ending/ no longer free and were my essential tools.","I accepted G+ died, fun but didn't work.

I used the old Google Reader for podcasts, but that went.

I used to use Google Photos constantly for albums and creating 'Stories', but then Stories went.

Also Face tagging? I can't remember if it even came to the UK. I put effort into getting it to work but what's the point.

Then they massively changed the photo editor, and I think the way albums were shared, so I stopped editing and sharing. I was hoping to get back to that, I just wanted them to stop removing changing features.

My partner and I regularly use and rely on Google Print. We even chose the printer because it supported it. So we'll need to set up a raspberry pi server now for printer sharing.

I don't mind the change from GPM to YouTube Music, but why not just rebrand instead of change everything.

I've used Hangouts for years with family and friends, and now I think that's going too.

I have many Google Docs which are going to be a problem now they're going to count towards storage.

Timnit Gebru,"In these times we should all want someone like Timnit Gebru involved in our social networking debate.

It is sad and all too pathetic that a post referencing this former Google employee isn't constantly at the top of the list.

No matter what your political affiliation or beliefs Timnit Gebru represents accountability and a widened perspective at one of the largest companies in the world.

I would understand if the termination had any sort of sense to it but thus far it seems like anyone at a higher level saw the impact of an honest appraisal and opinion from their own employee and simply saw the impact to their bottom line.

This is said when in fact Timnit Gebru would only allow them to be a better company yet it also puts their position power and a global brand at risk. Let alone the bottom line.

Google if you have ANY integrity reinstate Timnit Gebru immediately.

I encourage every person who cares about this absolute obvious attempt at salvaging profits/status and holding the bottom line to speak out and not let this just fly by.

This is an individual who promotes true integrity at an organization that has tangible effects in the world that currently they abuse.",google

Miscarriage/Ectopic Pregnancy,"Hello,

I don't know where else to seek help, I'll try here to see if anybody could help me out with advise on what to do?

Back in August found out I had a miscarriage a week after my menstrual cycle was suppose to be here. 

I make an appointment to see a doctor, I go see and tell them my situation, they just tell me I had a miscarriage and that it's normal to bleed then it will dry up. The thing is, I was asked by a few people, did the doctor examine you? Did the doctor tell you the reason for the miscarriage? NO to both questions. I was told they are suppose to treat you and get the remaining tissue that's left inside. But no they did not do that. A month passes, it's now end of September, still did not get my period. I took a pregnancy test, said I was pregnant. I made another doctors appointment, made me take a in house pregnancy test, confirmed I was pregnant. But they didn't examine me, at all. Just wrote me a prescription for Prenatals, another month goes by, it's now the end of November, Thanksgiving. The day before turkey day I started experiencing terrible pain in my side. I laid down most of the day, my partner laid by me to get me to sleep, I fell asleep until 3 AM, shot up with terrible pain. My partner took me to the ER, bless his heart, he wasn't able to be there, but super thankful he took me, I was not able to do anything, the pain was excruciating. I sat in the ER until 11AM on thanksgiving, did an emergency surgery. Removed one my fallopian tubes, my fallopian tube ruptured, the fallopian tube was 3IN in diameter, fallopian tubes are only supposed to be 1CM in diameter not 3 inches in diameter, was bleeding internally. My mother said the doctor told her I was about 20 weeks pregnant, I should've technically only been 6 weeks at the time. 

Can I get advice, please? I don't want this to happen to anybody else in the future.",google

I had Google Home Minis in my house for quite some time now but this happened only on this 2nd gen product. So, I was in a call with my girlfriend and I tend to put the speaker on mute and somehow the speaker heard her saying the trigger word, ""Hey Google"", and after a few seconds the assistant replied with ""Didn't catch that"". We both freaked out as we weren't expecting this. This is actually a real experience, this isn't a conspiracy or something like that.

Dear Google.,"With sadness I must ask you to stop enforcing ads in the amount you do on services like YouTube.

First you gather my data which I gave you for free. Then you sold that data for profit after which advertisers pay you a second time to show me specific ads and finally you expect me to pay an additional fee not to see those ads. 

I think I speak for all of us when I say not everyone can afford to pay for every premium streaming service.
There was a time when YouTube had no ads and I understand that time is over, but surely there must be a middle ground that does not show me 3 ads in between searching (not even watching) video's.

The internet has become unusable without adblockers and it is partly your fault.

I must be a freak of nature to be bothered by ads as much as I do since everyone else does not seem to mind..",google

I am pretty convinced that Google extracts data from Android Messages,"Certainly my evidence is circumstantial, but in this case, I can hardly think of a proper alternative. In a recent text message thread between the men in my family, we were discussing restoring old hand saws. The only exchanges were text and images of the saw in question. No links, and I didn't do any research on my own.

In my Google News Feed today, an article about saw sharpening. Is it already known that Android Messages are open to data extraction? Is there any known way to opt out of this? It certainly feels invasive to me.",google

Google does not share my personal data with me,"Last week, I factory reset the phone because my phone suddenly turned off and then entered bootloop. From now on, all my assurance was my Whatsapp chat backup backed up on Google Drive.

But after the phone was turned back on and I installed WhatsApp; Although WhatsApp saw my backup, it couldn't recover my chat history.

&amp;#x200B;

After the ""Backup found"" warning, I pressed the ""restore"" button and got the ""Check your internet connection and tap Retry to restore"" error.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dtbujx96lz461.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743b803aca46b577756429aa5453e33a12caa372

Besides, the box containing the size of the backup was empty. I entered the program to download my ""backup"" file directly from Google Drive.

But I found that I could not download my backups from Google Drive.

I posted tickets wherever necessary and called by phone, but no one from Google, one of the largest companies in the world, helped me and said that this file could not be downloaded.

They did not allow me to receive a file that belonged to me and that I put there.

Disabled people's experiences using YouTube,"Hi everyone, I'm currently carrying out a postgraduate research project into disabled people's experiences using YouTube. This includes accessing and navigating the platform, what you may like about the site and what you may dislike.

Google doesn't share my backups," 

Last week, I factory reset the phone because my phone suddenly turned off and then entered bootloop. From now on, all my assurance was my Whatsapp chat backup backed up on Google Drive.

But after the phone was turned back on and I installed WhatsApp; Although WhatsApp saw my backup, it couldn't recover my chat history.

After the ""Backup found"" warning, I pressed the ""restore"" button and got the ""Check your internet connection and tap Retry to restore"" error.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides, the box containing the size of the backup was empty. I entered the program to download my ""backup"" file directly from Google Drive.

But I found that I could not download my backups from Google Drive.

I posted tickets wherever necessary and called by phone, but no one from Google, one of the largest companies in the world, helped me and said that this file could not be downloaded.

They did not allow me to receive a file that belonged to me and that I put there.

Since I cannot download this file, for what purpose does Google allow me to store my chat and media history on its server?

Give my Whatsapp backup back to me!

### Sicilia: le spiagge più famose, le offerte per i bambini e i pacchetti all inclusive per le famiglie con bambini.

[Vacanze in Sicilia](https://preview.redd.it/hzi48m500q461.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d75729eda2555337cd7699ab5efcffba9ea1d700)

**La Sicilia** è ricca di spiagge meravigliose, dalla **sabbia fine** e con colori particolari, cristallini, dorati e rosei. L’acqua blu rispecchia una tonalità originale e crea paesaggi da cartolina, da poter ammirare da vicino e anche dalla finestra dell’alloggio scelto, dati i numerosi **villaggi turistici sul mare** tra i quali poter scegliere. Proprio questi permettono di scegliere anche tra tantissimi tipi di **offerte** diverse, tante anche per i bambini e molte composte da **pacchetti all inclusive** per le **famiglie con bambini**.

### Sicilia: le spiagge più famose e da visitare assolutamente.

La Sicilia è una regione ricca di storia, di tradizioni particolari, di una cucina tipica invidiata anche nel resto del mondo, ma anche da tante spiagge in grado di stupire chiunque abbia modo di visitarle. Tra queste ci sono **la spiaggia di Scopello**, **la spiaggia di Cefalù**, quella di **Punta Secca, Capo Passero**, ma anche **Le Saline**, **Marina di Ragusa**, la **Riserva naturale dello Zingaro e Levanzo**.  
Tutte queste possono essere visitate scegliendo [**villaggi turistici in Sicilia last minute**](https://villaggiestivi.com/villaggi-in-sicilia/), che offrono tanti sconti vantaggiosi e convenienti per i clienti.

### Le offerte per i bambini e i pacchetti all inclusive per le famiglie con bambini.

Quando che si prenota una **vacanza in Sicilia,** si desidera risparmiare non solo sul viaggio, ma anche sul soggiorno e sul pernottamento dei bambini. Per questo, i villaggi turistici siciliani mettono a disposizione dei clienti tante **offerte all inclusive**, cioè quelle che includono in un unico prezzo sia i costi per le notti prenotate nella struttura, sia quelli riguardanti le escursioni o i pasti.  
In generale, tutte le all inclusive di solito comprendono la mezza pensione o la pensione completa, il lido convenzionato, il servizio spiaggia e la prima colazione, ma questo elenco può variare a seconda della struttura.  
Con le all inclusive di certo il risparmio è assicurato e spesso nel prezzo del pacchetto sono inclusi anche soggiorni gratuiti per animali o per bambini. Per quanto riguarda i primi, sono numerose le strutture che in Sicilia vengono chiamate **“Pet friendly”**, cioè che garantiscono la possibilità di portare con sé animali domestici. In tal modo si potrà anche evitare la preoccupazione di dover affidare l’animale a qualche pensione, con il rischio che poi si senta solo o comunque che non sia trattato adeguatamente.  
Sempre nelle **all inclusive** di solito sono anche inclusi i prezzi relative ad attrazioni quali animazioni che **l’hotel o il villaggio** organizza durante il giorno o la sera. Altre strutture però permettono l’accesso a tali attività soltanto con la sottoscrizione della tessera club. In più i bambini da 0 a 3 anni non pagano il soggiorno e hanno la possibilità di dormire insieme ai genitori senza un supplemento sul prezzo. Diverso il discorso per prenotare la culla, che richiede una cifra maggiore. Oltre a questo, è possibile anche scegliere pacchetti completi che includono il pernottamento dei piccoli e anche escursioni per la famiglia oppure che offrono sconti per tutti i familiari. Per molte strutture c’è anche l’**offerta sulla nave gratis** andata e ritorno per le escursioni. Per avere una vacanza fantastica basterà solo scegliere l’offerta più consona alle proprie richieste e prenotare, così da poter osservare la meravigliosa Sicilia.",google

I've just got the Google Search dark theme for desktop!!,"I was googling for something and it was blinding-white as usual, and a couple of seconds afterwards I googled something in a new tab and, VWALA, it was like this. Happened at 12:56 PM GMT+2 (maybe at 55, IDK). Doesn't work in incognito mode or in Firefox. Chrome version 87 on Windows (I will boot Ubuntu later to check whether it works on Linux as well). Sadly, [Google.com](https://Google.com) hompage is still light themed. And again, NO EXTENSION USED. My old friend Dark Reader is turned off!

Suddenly can't pay with my CC in Google Play or in games,"So suddenly I'm getting this error (OR-URISH-01) and some other error ending with ""35"", whenever I'm trying to purchase anything in app store or in-game. I used the same credit card just two days ago, and I have been using this card for months now without any problems, but now suddenly this.

Any idea what I can do to fix it? It says to contact my bank, but they can't see any restrictions on the card. I can still use my cards in physical stores and I can also purchase stuff online from Amazon and such, no problems. It's only in Google related situations that it doesn't work. It's really annoying as I have several payment plans (Google drive and other subscriptions) tied to this card via Play Store and they will be declined in the future unless I fix this.

Any help is much appreciated!

Bonus info: I have checked the addresses are still matching and that the balance on the card is capable of making the purchase. The card is set to expire in 2023.",google

La Puglia: guida turistica e culturale," **La Puglia**, sotto il nome comune di **Japigi**, con cui vengono poi conosciuti dai greci, varie popolazioni sviluppano fiorenti culture di cui le ricerche archeologiche hanno restituito importanti testimonianze: i Dauni nel Gargano e nella Capitanata, i Peucezi nella terra di Bari e nelle Murge, i Messapi nel Salento. Solo a partire dall’ VIII secolo a.C., con l’arrivo dei coloni giunti da Sparta e dalla Laconia e la fondazione di città come Gallipoli, Otranto e Taranto. A dare il via all’età in assoluto più fulgida della Puglia è l’avvento degli Svevi con la figura di Federico II, con il sorgere di monumenti di splendore ineguagliabile, chiese, cattedrali, palazzi, castelli, la cui perfezione si riassume nell’opera più celebre e più significativa del periodo federiciano: Castel del Monte. E’ il momento più alto della vita civile e culturale della **Puglia**. **Nel Salento** centinaia di torri, costiere ed interne, rimangono a testimoniare la costante lotta contro le scorrerie di invasori di ogni genere e pirati che minacciarono per secoli. La quasi totalità delle torri costiere salentine fu eretta nel 1500 dagli Spagnoli. L’incubo delle invasioni e dei saccheggi turchi, che culminarono nella strage degli ottocento martiri d’Otranto indusse a costruire una fitta rete di luoghi di osservazione tra loro collegati dai quali trasmettere, sia all’interno che sulla fascia costiera, gli allarmi lanciati dalla costa. A causa del loro numero davvero elevato, non esiste un itinerario che indichi le torri più importanti, eppure, anche l’osservatore più distratto non può fare a meno di notare la loro presenza sulla costa. Tra le più importanti sono: **Torre Sabea**, presso Gallipoli, **Torre Santa Caterina**, **Torre Lapillo**, **Torre dell’Alto**, **Torre Chianca**, **Torre dell’Orso**, e la suggestiva Torre del Fiume, meglio nota come **Quattro Colonne**. Una funzione difensiva avevano anche le centinaia di masserie fortificate, costruzioni quasi fiabesche, che compaiano inaspettate agli occhi del viaggiatore. Il [Salento](https://villaggiestivi.com/villaggi/villaggi-in-puglia/robinson-club-apulia/) è anche terra dai contrasti che si fondono per dare un unico grande risultato: un paesaggio unico e suggestivo, caratterizzato dal contrasto tra terra e mare, tra terra e pietra, tra vegetazione ed edilizia. E’ uno scrigno di arte e storia, la Puglia che merita di essere conosciuta e apprezzata per le bellezze naturali, artistiche, culturali ed architettoniche che caratterizzano questa terra, un autentico diamante incastonato tra un anello di mare dal chiaro di luna e dorato dal sole al tramonto. La Regione, il mare le sue spiagge, i tanti [villaggi in Puglia](https://villaggiestivi.com/), sono la ricchezza, che ogni anno nel cuore del Mediterraneo, un viaggio o una vacanza, attende il turista di bagnarsi nelle acque cristalline e sdraiarsi sulle spiagge dorate o nuotare tra i riflessi smeraldini delle grotte. La Puglia terra di vacanze con il sole caldo, con il mare favolosamente tranquillo e limpido, con le spiagge immerse nella quiete più rasserenate e con i colori marcati e unici che caratterizzano un paesaggio fiabesco e incontaminato.L’ospitalità della gente, l’incantevole bellezza del suo mare, delle sue coste in parte rocciose e in parte sabbiose, della sua natura, rendono questa terra unica e sublime in tutti gli aspetti. 

[villaggi in Puglia](https://preview.redd.it/k2j8hqt41t461.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e56ecfc80215c29926205233e669bc48d87d9ea8)",google

Google Dev tools client vs server,"There's some changes that are local to the user but if a user does one of the following would it work?

There's a checkbox that sets the value of exampleVar to its value and there's a button that on press will signal function and in the function script there's an if statement

If (exampleVar==false){
Lose ()
}

If (exampleVar==true){
Win ()
}

So what if the user changed the script to call win if==false and don't call lose?

Also what happens if he changed exampleVar value from console?

Will the button send win if any of two things were done? Or I don't understand the difference between client and server.

Google TV youtube Autoplay,"So. I have a habit of turning the TV off without pausing the video because I was under the assumption that the power button on the remote turned off the TV and the Google TV off simultaneously. 

But I just learned today that Google has been letting Autoplay run while my TV was off. It went from a Chris Stuckmann review to a free movie and then it just started cycling through free movies. Now that's a bunch of free movies that I have ""watched"" while my TV was off. I think this is a very deceiptful and shady practice, keeping youtube running in the background while my TV is off. Why wouldn't the power button also turn the Google TV off? Why would it just keep autoplaying without a source connected to it? Why would my TV keep giving the Google TV power while it's off?

I have been getting very annoyed and concerned about the way my Google stuff interacts with me. Im getting ads on Instagram linked to my Google search history, It's constantly asking me to review things in Maps when I'm just trying to get navigations started. And It feels the need to remind me what google home can do when giving it simple tasks like turning alarms off and checking the weather.",google

Even if google notify the user which apparently got ignored by me. I think google should at least keep the old subscription work as it is. Google just really doesn't care about their customers. In engineering world, they keep making backward-incompatible changes to meet the ""Google"" level engineer standard. When it comes to consumer products, break the user contract for old users and give me a fking big surprise. 

I'm gonna find some Apple home-security video supported cam to replace my nest cam.

"Anyone else ever have a hard time getting their card to connect to Google Pay then get this error message? Because it was obviously in error, I can't find it anywhere else online, and Google treated it as infallible.","I'm with Tangerine as of yesterday (Canadian basically-online bank, chosen because it has 0 fees). Some percentage of users have serious problems getting Apple/Google Pay to work with it, some have no problem, I was in the worse of the two groups.

Spent most of the day going through all the troubleshooting steps the internet (and eventually, when I realized the secret 'talk to a human being' code on the bank's phone number, from the bank itself). I, obviously, did all of this from one device, on my personal domain's GSuite Account because I don't own thirty different smartphones that *all* can't authenticate this card. I could *only* add it from my phone too because the bank's Visa Debit cards are new enough that Google can't recognize the first six characters as part of a legitimate credit card number except through the photo part in the Pay app. 

Getting it into Google Pay really mattered because if I couldn't, I'd have to maintain a separate bank account, with the fees I'm running from, just to pay for my GSuite account. 

Then, all of a sudden I got a message basically telling me ""you've added it too many times, remove it from a device to try again"" and, well, it's hard to remove it from anything when it isn't *on* anything. 

I kind of assumed the process would be a little like when you call Microsoft after Word and Windows deauthenticate following a swap in GPUs or something. Instead, I was told that the error message could not possibly not be true. It was *obviously* correct, I was obviously wrong, and they didn't give a shit what that meant. Well, not in those words, but having a screaming match over whether ""saying that the thing you are saying is not true"" and ""calling me a liar"" are the same thing is pretty close to that. 

I've googled around a bit and there are literally no other matches for [this](https://i.imgur.com/lkrJ5RK.png) bug online - guess I'm just the first person to try to cheat the system by failing to put my personal debit card on 500 people's phones, I suppose - but all the results that come up from partial matches in my personal bubble are people having the same problem I did with Tangerine. 

Just wondering if I'm actually alone here, and if anyone else has ever had Google support outright shut them down to the extent they need to either wait two weeks for a new bank card or cancel GSuite? Because I'm personally floored. I've argued for GSuite in rooms full of people insisting on Teams. I've configured seven-figure deployments on GCP over AWS when AWS was objectively the easier option. Hell, I had that argument from a pixel phone. 

For all that I tend to shit on anyone who buys into Consumer Tribalism and really has a 'team' in things, I guess this was mine, and it genuinely hurts more than I expected to get fucked over like this for no apparent reason.",google

Google account-serious problem,"Hey guys, well I've been trying everything I can (even called google but the phone doesn't ring), the thing is I have two accounts, the main account is where I have linked YT, Steam, and all related to that, and then I have the other account where I used to work, when I created the second account, I used my main account as a back up. Now, I don't know how, out of nowhere family link got involved, What I mean by this?, my main account turned as a parent account and my second account as a kid account, I did try to delete the family link, but I can't because when I created the account, I made a mistake putting instead of 2001, I put 2011, and every time I try to change it says ""I can't change if the kid is under 13"" and the same thing happens if I try to delete the family link, it's getting annoying at that point that I cannot even sell my PC because of this, if I lose this account, I cannot work.

Cookies in incognito,"I know this has been talked about and there is a law suit being filed currently as we speak but i never thought these allegations against google were true. 

This thread is a way to warn people of the internet, especially search engines. 

I always used incognito mode to search absolutely anything since i always hated the fact that google showed my previous searches. Even though they weren't embarassing in any shape or form, i found a certain guilt in them due to my introverted ways, going to a vegan party for that fact and someone saw my previous search of ""chicken fried rice"" which seemed to align to what i brought on that bring and share and no there was no chicken. 
 
Not being sidetracked, i have been looking up a lot for deals on electric guitars obviously by habbit in incognito mode. The site offered cookies and I declined them. When i was done browsing i went to instagram to open some notifications and see what dumb jokes my friends sent me. To my surprise i saw multiple ads for guitar tuitions and guitar sellers. 

If this really means what it means, every dude on this planet is not safe.

TL:DR ; i know its DDD but your searches in incognito might be manifested elsewhere",google

In a recent attempt to solve this, I cleared off no less than half a gig and your ads gobbled it all up.  

My phone continually works in a compromised mode because it has no space open for apps and processes to operate.  I even tried to make an emergency call for a person collapsed on the street and my phone was so compromised and slow that it was a full 5 minutes before I could even get at my phone dial pad.

Variety of Google Verification Code Formats,"Today I received an unprompted Verification Code for my Google Account. But it was different from the other codes I received from Google, so it got me thinking, What are all the different formats, and to what services do they belong?  


I'm sure you're all familiar with the   
**G-XXXX is your Google verification code.**  
variant. I'm pretty sure this is the generic verification for the google single sign-on. 

Then there's the Google Voice version:  
**&lt;#&gt; XXXX is your Google Voice verification code. Don't share it with anyone else. (Then a link)**  
that's the newer one. I've got old google voice ones that drop the '&lt;#&gt;' in the beginning and the ""don't share this"" warning.

But then occasionally I get unprompted google verifications that go like this  
**&lt;#&gt; Your Google verification code is XXXX. 0PYGGQiwfmU**  
I have no clue what this code is for. Specifically that string of text on the end. I tried looking it up and just found a bunch of websites that post texts and this string is attached to the end. I'm super confused about what service it is for.

If anyone has any clues on the mystery service, please enlighten me. 

also, post any other formats for services too (omit the code please)",google

Send out questions in multiple Google forms as a set,"Hi,
I have created a questionnaire using Google Forms for an assessment of around 100 questions. Realising that the current Google Forms do not support to save in the middle of answering the questions, I have split them into eight parts so that they can fill out a small set of questions and submit each time. 

However, this is not ideal when there are many people to answer eight forms each. 

Is there a way to bundle all the eight Google Forms as a set and send it in one go?

Thank you.",google

COVID 19 Predicitons," Back at February and March we've build couple of models that we've used to predict the future of COVID-19 in terms of number of new, healed and deceased cases. Back than, it was considered wrong, and how it is not OK to do such stuff, because we claim that we can do better predictions than doctors and other specialists, but our mission was to showcase how AI can be used to assist in situations like this.  We were using data gathered in 3 mounts period, and our predictions was for mouths April and May.  Here is our first, and easiest to understand article.

Strange bug in Google's search engine... Can anyone else verify if they get the same results?!,"So the other day I was wondering what the word ""bаіliff"" means after reading a post mentioning one (apparently it means court officer). Either way - I googled the word yesterday and got no results except the actual Reddit thread I had just visited. Asked some guy what it meant, tried to Google it again – got the actual wikipedia page and the results you'd expect.

So now I'm sitting with two windows open. If I copy the word from the right page and past it into google, I get the correct results, and if I copy-paste the incorrect ""bailiff"" into Google I get the wrong results. So maybe he was using some weird non-standard characters for one of the letters? 

  
Nope. If I copy-paste ""bailiff"" into the search bar, or anywhere else, then copy-paste it back into Google I get the correct results. So what is going on here?

My theory: Google's AI bugged the fuck out, and is much more advanced than I previously imagined. It can tell from which source I have used to copy-paste something, which is why when I copy the word from the original thread, I get the incorrect search results. 

Try it for yourselves and if see if it happens to you, just copy-paste ""bailiff"":

Google just made your headphones easier to use. Smart or not.,"We use our headphones for everything; music, work, phone calls, and much more. A lot of high-end companies have implemented solutions to make theirs' the smartest, but what if you can afford those? 

Beginning to roll out today, when you plug in or connect a pair of headphones to your Android device, you will get a notification: ""Talk to assistant on your headphones."" You may be fooled and think that they're just trying to encourage you to use the system already set in place, but if you look deeper, they've made your life a whole lot easier.

Tapping on the notification opens a set-up screen in the Google app which allows you to get the new Google Assistant UI for headphones up and running. It works with anything that can produce sound, and has a pause/play button on it too, so buying an expensive pair is no longer a need. It will show you cool tricks like if you long press the ""action button"" you can have your notifications read to you, and much more.

This is one of the best mini-features I've seen google add yet, as it brings even dollar store earbuds to the 21st century by making them alot smarter than they were yesterday. Great going google, I can't wait to see more.

Tested on: 12/2/2020 12:00pm OnePlus6T Android 10 with wired earbuds.

(I rushed to get something on paper, so apologies if it's a bit scuffed. I'm working on a better overview, but I thought I should get out what I can)

Help with google cardboard app/VR headset," Hi, today I got a pair of Virtual reality goggles (they're called ""Hi-shock VR-shark X6""), I connected them with bluetooth to my phone (a Huawei p8 lite 2017) and, after opening the google cardboard app I just installed and scanning the QR code on the headset's instructions, i put my phone in the headset. I completed the google app's tutorial and after that i removed my phone from the headset. Then, while the google cardboard app was open, I accidentally turned off my phone's screen (by pressing the power button) and now it won't turn on anymore (I'm 100% sure the phone is on tho, for example my pc will recognize it when I connect them with a usb cable).

"Looking for a Google Play Music replacement, where I can buy, and download songs locally","Looking for a store where I can 1) own my own music, 2) download and play the music locally on my phone (rather than streaming).  Yes, I know ""ownership"" of digital media isn't ownership, but I'm opposed to subscription models; I have my reasons like everyone.  ""You're dumb, just do a subscription streaming service"" doesn't help me.  If anyone has suggestions, advice, or if I've got it wrong on one of these options, let me know it would be super appreciated, here's where I'm at and what I've looked at so far with a bit of internet searching:  


Subscription based/has ads (not interested): Spotify, Apple Music, Youtube Music, Deezer, Pandora, Tidal, Jamendo, Qobuzetc.

Lacking music library/niche stores (not interested): Bandcamp, 7digital, HDtracks, (of these 7digital seems the best, it has most of what I'd need.  Would this be a good option, does anyone use it?  It's a consideration for me.)

Amazon music: not interested, Amazon is about as evil as megacorporations come and I have my own pedant little boycott on them.

Itunes: I believe if I got itunes on my PC, bought music through them, downloaded it, then manually put it on my android phone to use with some whatever mp3 player it should work? (correct me if I'm wrong?)  I'm not a huge fan of Apple either, (see evil company argument above, but at least to a lesser extent than Amazon).  This is an option I'd consider.

CDs: I kind of moved away from CDs, 1) to minimalize and get rid of physical stuff and clutter, 2) digital media is a more logical option, no needless plastics, or physical products that could get damaged and wear out, vs. infinite redownloads from a store.  But buying CDs again and pulling the files to play on my device is probably my top pick at this point, but I'm still less keen on it than a digital option.

Getting an iphone and using itunes on it: I would really miss the flexibility of Android, as I've particularly been enjoying Retroarch and emulation on my phone lately, so this would pretty much be a no go.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts!?  Is anyone else going through this?  I realize I'm being an old school, pedantic git, but these are priorities for me, and downloading tracks, and owning them (even digitally) are my two biggest priorities.",google

What to expect in 2021 from Google’s Knowledge Graph Updates,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ugk2g4tb3j161.jpg?width=5239&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd9420c734129330d8d67e1145c4392eb17481f4

To those folks who are accustomed doing search engine optimization (SEO), we’ve been viewing URLs stuffed with content, and links between that content, however algorithms like PageRank (based upon links pointed between pages) and data retrieval scores primarily based upon the connection of that content are determinative how well pages rank in search engines and ends up in response to queries entered into search boxes by searchers. Websites connected by links are seen as info points connected by nodes. This was the primary generation of SEO .  
 

Chances are pretty high that several of the strategies that we've been exploiting and trying to do [Seo Friendly Website](https://www.kontorara.com/step-by-step-guide-to-build-an-seo-friendly-website/) can stay the identical as new options seem in search, like knowledge panels, rich results, featured snippets, structured snippets, search by photos, and enlarged schema covering more industries and options then it does at the moment.  
 

Search has been longing a change. Back in 2012, Google introduced one thing it refers to as the knowledge graph, within which they told us that they might begin focusing upon assortment things rather than strings. By “strings,” they were concerning words that seem in queries, and in documents on the net. By “things,” they were concerning named entities, or real and specific folks, places, and things. when people searched at Google, the search engines would show (SERPs) full of URLs to pages that contained the strings of letters that we have a tendency to were searching for. Google still does that, and is slowly changing to showing search results that are regarding individuals, places, and things. In amalgamation of crawling and indexing the words of web pages,  Google is collecting all information of the people, places, and things it finds on those pages. Read :-[What is EDI Integration](https://www.kontorara.com/what-is-edi-integration/)

**Google’s Knowledge Graph Updates itself in following ways**

(1) The information Graph might be refreshed with at least one recently performed searches. 

(2) The Knowledge Graph might be refreshed with a natural dialect inquiry, utilizing disambiguation question terms related to the entity reference, wherein the terms involve property estimations related to the entity reference. 

(3) The Knowledge Graph may utilize properties related to the entity reference to incorporate data updating missing information components. Following would remain the tentative pattern of updates for the Google’s Knowledge Graph Updates in 2020.

**Which are the sources that Google Knowledge Graph utilizes ?**

Google either uses serious, publicly-accessible knowledge or knowledge from its own inventory for the display of the knowledge Graph. Current sources, alongside Wikidata, additionally embrace the content from Agriculture Department (US Department of Agriculture) [Mining For Cryptocurrency](https://supdrew.com/how-mining-for-cryptocurrency-ripple-can-gain-epitome-position-in-near-future/).

The Google Knowledge Graph additionally uses content from websites, that the corporate trusts. This can be specifically the case for definitions. what is more, there should be structured knowledge for sure search queries (rich snippets), that are known with Mark-ups. It's solely during this method that this info may be scan out and displayed by [SEO Agency](https://www.volantseo.com/).

**What effects will the Knowledge Graph will be seen on SEO?**

The Knowledge Graph has each blessings and drawbacks to websites and search engine optimisation (SEO). As users sometimes don't need an extra click to search out the specified data, websites with a high data share will lose traffic in general search queries. This traffic loss may also lead to losses in advertising revenue. However, the chance to be listed by Google during a Knowledge Graph with a text or image link typically seen to as a positive.

Content should, for instance, incline mark-up language to extend the chance of being displayed during a knowledge Graph. There is a chance to label this mark-up information which is offered by schema.org. This information should even be correct and up-to-date. Note that there's no guarantee that your web site are displayed on the graph. Google’s algorithmic program decides on the display. Google itself has not given any more information on this.

SEO friendly website is a perfect alternative to get more traffic. These sites are fully accessible. Moreover, it focuses on fulfilling the user preferences. But many of the web designers fail to understand the importance of SEO friendly websites. The possible reason for the same is the unawareness of fruitful practice. Many do not know how to make your website SEO friendly. These probable reasons serve as a restriction that enforces web developers to ignore search engines.

When it comes to designing an SEO friendly website, it is a hard nut to crack if you are unaware of SEO website design tips. Working without a mere idea about the existence of the right tactics for building an SEO friendly website is almost an impossible deal. So, before developing a best SEO website design, make sure that you are aware of SEO website design tips. The same will help you achieve fruitful results with minimal effort and time investment. Also, to fetch more out of your website aim to design and develop the site as per the users along with search engine is necessary. The same will enable you to ensure a smart build by prioritizing the users first.",google

Not able to access anything google,"About 5 days ago I noticed that my YouTube app stopped working and would just crash as soon as I tried to open it. I tried all of the fixes online and nothing seemed to work and so I just decided I would wait it out. Well this morning I noticed that my Google photos account did the same thing. So I got thinking I would try several google apps and without fail all of them immediately crash when trying to open them. I’ve used all of the same apps through safari and they work fine and all of them open just fine on my computer. I’m so lost at this point and have no clue what to do or what the problem is.

TLDR-YouTube and all other google apps on my iPhone crash immediately but work on other devices and safari. Also it’s just google apps that have been affected.",google

3 worst things about Google ending unlimited photos storage...,"1) Quality: Many of us got our photos compressed to lower quality because we were getting free unlimited storage. If we knew google was gonna stop the unlimited storage this soon, we would have thought about keeping photos at original quality.

2) Privacy: They promised free unlimited storage and so many of us forgo our privacy, we all know google used our images to strengthen their AI to make their search feature (google photos search feature) so strong. Now that their search feature is strong enough they are like ""we don't need you anymore"".

3) Competition: There is no such service left, not even close, that can search and categorise our photos this accurately. This is essentially because Google gave unlimited storage, and so nobody could compete. Google had other income sources to support Google Photos. Now that there are no competitors, they can charge whatever they want. The free unlimited plan had a big hidden cost.

Finding permanently deleted photos,"I feel so silly, but I accidentally deleted 1.5 years of photos this morning from Google Photos -- I'm hoping there is some way to recover them?

I have a Huawei P20 phone, and was using Google Photos as a backup. I'm getting a new phone in a few weeks, and I was hoping to clear out some of the photos backed up on Google photos that I had deleted from my phone. I guess I was just unaware that photos deleted from a Google backup are also deleted from your phone gallery, because it's not the same the other way around?

Long story short, I'm wondering if there is a way to recover permanently deleted items from Google Photos on my phone. I've tried a number of recovery apps, but none seem to access the photos permanently deleted from Google.

[rant] Google and I are done,"I originally posted in r/googlepay given what caused me to write this, but it was suggested to me that I share it here too. In my defiant frustration with this behemoth of a company I’m doing so.

&lt;rant&gt;

I used to be a Google and Android user and even somewhat of a fan. Oh how times have changed. Sure Android devices generally cost less and often see more cutting edge features than their fruit alternatives, but I truly feel a rather steep price is paid with the difficulty and occasional impossibility of maintaining any semblance of digital privacy in the Googleverse. In 2015 I got an iPhone mainly for this reason and never once looked back...and will indeed never go back. Sure Google makes fairly good and often innovative products but the hidden price of “free” for most of it has become entirely too high for me.

Nonetheless, there are certain situations where I will accept trading off and using this company’s services, and one in particular where I’m forced to if I want to have any semblance of a complete modern internet existence. There is zero viable alternative to YouTube. None. The towel was already thrown in for me there.

Google Voice is also a very unique service that doesn’t have a check all the boxes alternative. I used this all the time when I lived overseas for a bit to talk to people back in the US without paying an arm and a leg, or in fact anything, to do it. They probably have some sort of activity tracking or maybe even conversation recording/analyzing tech there too, but hey at the time the potential data collection and analysis was an acceptable trade off for the no cost calls home they provided that I constantly made use of with a foreign SIM’s cellular data, again through an iPhone. Call me paranoid all you want, I don’t trust these tech giants as far as I could kick their HQ buildings like soccer balls around Silicon Valley. Which is none. You shouldn’t either.

My main point of the keyboard mashing fest happening right now is that Google Pay was far and away the biggest example where I was absolutely fine and in fact happy with trading my data for their services. I used Google Pay constantly as an Apple user for the absolute singular reason that they had zero instant transfer fee to a debit card. I curiously looked at their new app release and stumbled across the new policy with their so called “improved” revamp, they will be generously matching Square Cash with a 1.5% instant transfer fee if you so much as touch the new app. Square Cash has the highest fee in the industry that I know of by the way. I guess Google felt some sort of insane need to go from zero fee to getting outdone by frickin PayPal in this area. I don’t know of anyone else anywhere that has a free instant transfer offering, but I will surely be doing some research shortly that will more than likely unfortunately end in futility. Essentially all of the other companies in this space have vastly different business models than Google therefore they charge fees to get your money this way. Different revenue stream. Again, a situation I was totally cool with trading a slight wade into that bag of worms to avoid paying out of my pocket. I guess so much for that.

Google is one of the central companies in the world that operate with the model of your use of their products and those products using you meshing to incredible levels, right up there with Facebook. Now they still continue to want to analyze you down to the point of every single thing you click on or action you perform anywhere on the internet, and oh by the way they’re going to start introducing some “small” fees for the privilege of partaking in this instantaneously meshed reality. Yeah, no. I’m out. 

I sure as hell will not be touching that “great new” app with a ten foot pole and when the old app and platform ceases to work, my slow walk away from most Google services will turn into an all out sprint. My Gmail accounts have held on for daily use until now simply because of the hugely arduous task of changing your email with every single service and company you do business with. I had already opened some new email accounts elsewhere to attempt an escape from Google’s AI machine beast that likely monitors and analyzes intricate details of my life that exist in the modern inbox even though I personally specifically tell it not to. They can be 100% sure I’m gonna be very shortly sucking it up, buckling down, and hammering through a transition to turn those accounts into glorified spam boxes now.

I have mostly used Google Maps until now too, because I like the interface marginally better and when I lived in a few major cities I found the transit info to be very superior. I’ll leave it installed for if that comes up, but I now live in a place where I have to drive everywhere. Apple Maps is fine for that. Again, adios.

The big kahuna, search, I’ve already been using DuckDuckGo for years. Yeah I know it’s not as intuitive but it’s a trade off I was and am still fully willing to accept for not giving this data hoarding company a consistent unfiltered window into my mind.

Some would call this transfer fee addition a minor change, but given my existing mounting frustration with Google and my extensive use of Google Pay specifically to avoid these types of fees, it is the straw that broke the camel’s back for me. Goodbye and good riddance Google. I will be kicking you out of my life in every way realistically possible going forward.

iOS google app scrolling bug,"Hi all, new here, apologies and lmk if this isn’t the correct place to post. The[Google app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google/id284815942) on iOS has an infuriating bug that ignores touch inputs at times. The video in the link below shows the bottom bar sliding in as I scroll up; it is also circled red in the still photo. If I quickly perform a second touch before the bottom bar is fully animated in, that touch is ignored, even if I hold it down long after the bar is fully animated in. The impact is that the screen is basically unresponsive until the bar animates in fully, which can be pretty far from where I intended to stop, especially if I do a quick flick upward. This is frustrating and cripples the Google app experience on iOS.

Doesn’t happen on other apps.

Tl;dr scrolling bug in Google iOS app ignores touches sometimes, makes for bad experience.

Anyone else have this issue? And what is the best way to escalate this?

"Is there any way to reimport oab, ost and nst files?","Hi,

Recently I had to rebuild an outlook profile from scratch, so I made a backup of the whole \appdata\local\microsoft\outlook with the OAB folder just in case.

But now, even if I replace the files from the new profile with the old folder, I still can't see the old address book and old infos.

Where did I go wrong? Are the contacts deleted? I had dozen of group contacts before. 

I didn't export my files  a csv from outlook so I'm afraid my group contacts are gone. 

Thanks",microsoft

Why does the Alexa app audio go to my 2nd monitor?,"Hello everyone,

I have a 2nd monitor attached to my laptop (via HDMI), but I have the default settings for sound set to my laptop. Never had an issue before (the audio in my skype/zoom calls, and browser all play from laptop speakers), but the audio from the Alexa app does not. It immediately goes to the 2nd monitor. Does anyone know how to resolve this? This appears to be App based, since all the other apps and programs on my computer don't have this issue, but I don't know what to do if that is the case.",microsoft
