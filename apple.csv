3,l66m9r,"Yesterday I did an in app purchase in the free app Wingsong: a cup of coffee donation for 3,49. I have PayPal connected to my Apple ID. Suddenly I get two confirmations: one for 3,49 and one for 7,99. Both written off my PayPal automatically. Has anyone ever had this?","I checked my purchase history right away after the double confirmation mails and it only shows the one purchase of 3,49. So it’s not like I purchased anything on accident or it’s any amount that would explain the 7,99. Also there was only seconds between the two sent mails.

I currently have contacted support at both Apple and PayPal and started a “dispute” in my PayPal for the 7,99 purchase I didn’t do. But it seemed so weird that it is somehow possible for Apple / App Store to write of money from my PayPal without anything purchased.. / confirming any payment at all. Did the dev do something shifty to write off a triple amount of my in app purchase / donation?",apple,submission

8,l67dry,Visual Studio 2019 and M1 Macbook Pro - hard crashes,"So just a heads up, I have not been through 3 replacement Macs thinking it was a hardware issue only to realise Visual Studio (in this case the one that gets installed with Unity) was causing hard lock crashes.  No idea why but I removed it and changed to Visual Studio Code and no more issues.

I do not know if it is some interplay between Unity and VS running at the same time but it was 100% that causing it - only thing remotely interesting with my setup is that I use an external 4k hdr monitor also and no extra apps installed running apart from LastPass.

So just incase anyone else has this problem - try swapping to Code.

Cheers",apple,submission

I was considering doing the trade in option for around 380 and getting a laptop pro. I would like your guys opinion on the pro 11 and the pro 12 or if anyone has a newer iPad that is not the pro that is cheaper and would do the job just as well. thank you!,apple,submission

19,l68tw3,Can't Listen on iTunes,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but I cannot find an answer anywhere.  I have an Apple Music subscription through Verizon that works great on my iPhone.  However, I cannot actually listen to music I don't have on iTunes on my Macbook.  For example, I can add a song to my library on my phone and it will allow me to play it on my Macbook, but if I haven't already added the song and just want to go listen to Music on my computer, it asks me to sign up for Apple Music.  The Verizon website says 

""Can I use my Apple Music subscription from Verizon on other devices besides my smartphone?

Yes, if you log in to iTunes or the Music app with the Apple ID that 's getting Apple Music from Verizon, you can access your saved music and playlists.""

Does this mean it's working like it should in that I can access my saved stuff but nothing new or is something wrong?

I am logged in with the same ID on all devices.  Apple Music works on my iPad which is wifi only and not associated with Verizon in anyway.

Hardware info:

iPhone X iOS 14.3

iPad Mini 4th Generation iOS 14.3

2015 Macbook Air Big Sur 11.1

After Windows 10 installed successfully I booted back into MacOS to get the Microsoft Supportsoftware but I noticed the TouchBar stopped working completely. TouchID doesn‘t work as well. If anyone had the same thing happen to them maybe share how you went about fixing this or if this is even fixable?

It's the app I wish I had while I was studying at university.

----

My long-standing frustration with software keyboards is that they still all use the same standard layout, providing the exact same set of symbols. Yet we all have our favourite emoji, and when you're learning any technical subjects, you'll know there's all sorts of obscure symbols to learn, none of which can be typed directly.

Keybuild is an app which lets you create your own keyboard. Starting with one of the built-in templates, you can change any of the keys to type whatever symbol you like. But it doesn't stop there.

Keybuild isn't just a keyboard editor, it's a keyboard builder. You can build your whole keyboard, from scratch if you choose, using a stack-based layout system. Fancy a number row above your keyboard, but don't want to fork out for the 12.9"" iPad? Fancy no longer, you can add one right in! Or add a dismiss button into your iPhone keyboard, to help reclaim precious screen real-estate at a touch!

Is one keyboard not enough? Needs reams and reams of symbols and emoji? Build multiple layouts, called ‘Panes’, and switch between them using either a direct Pane Link, or a ‘Pane Menu’ which presents a quick-switcher of all your panes. There's a few pane templates built-in, including the iOS Qwerty layouts for various device sizes, the default symbols pane, and a new custom one - extended symbols!

----

Keybuild is available now on the App Store → https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/keybuild/id1547174534

The app is a small, one-time purchase! My next update will add built-in symbol &amp; emoji search, to render copy &amp; paste fully obsolete. 😉",apple,submission

364,l41so4,We've released Ekko - a shared digital photo-frame widget for your homescreen you can use with your friends and family!,"Hi /r/Apple!

A few months ago my brother and I started work on a widget idea we both thought was pretty cool, and after lots of great feedback we've recently released it on the App Store.


The app is called **Ekko**, and it's a **shared digital photo frame widget for your iPhone and iPad**, where your friends and family can update which pictures are shown on the widget (and you can update theirs). We think of it like a little portal on your homescreen controlled by your friends and family. 


We've called it ""Ekko"", because the picture you post are ""echoed"" to the devices of everyone in the same stream, but eventually disappear :)


Using Ekko is super simple. First, you join or create a photo stream with the people you want to share with. Once you're in, you can post pictures to the stream and they'll appear in everyone's widget. You can also like and comment on the pictures in your streams, and after 24 hours, the photos disappear (except the most recent shown in the widget). There's also a cool giftwrapping feature where your picture will appear as a present on their homescreen until they open the app and unwrap it (you can re-wrap it too). 


Ekko has a premium mode which gives a few extra features, but we're giving that away for free for the first few hundred signups so we can see how people use the app and get more feedback! :)


A couple of weeks ago we shared Ekko on /r/iphone and had a great response, and lots of fantastic feedback - particularly from couples - but also from larger groups of friends and families keeping in touch. Since then we've released the iPad version, and some of our friends have tested it on M1, which apparently works perfectly. We don't have an M1 to hand, but if anyone here does and wants to test out Ekko, please let us know how it goes!


We're really excited to share Ekko with you, and we use it every day with our friends and family. We'd love to hear what you think!

(For those who haven't heard of it, Pinboard is a social bookmarking website with a plain design and a focus on personal management of bookmarks using tags to organize them, similar to early versions of Delicious)

Pins works very well with accounts of all sizes. No matter how many bookmarks you have — from 1,000 to even 100,000 — Pins can handle it.

Blurb: Offline access to all Pinboard bookmarks. Filter with smart collections. Share extension, drag-and-drop, Shortcuts app. Widgets, Spotlight search, Handoff, multitasking.

It’s built with iOS design guidelines in mind to look great in light and dark mode alike, along with containing multiple tints and themes to tweak the app your way. The intuitive ‘tap to copy’, and ‘long-press to share’ gestures coupled with the keyboard shortcuts also makes using the app super simple to pick up and use.

Multi-window support coupled with Drag and Drop is also extremely useful for quickly and easily dragging text from other apps directly into the app for quick transforming. Whether this is to add hashtags to words social picture sharing sites, or mimic mocking Spongebob in conversation with your friends, there’s something for everyone. There are also various ASCII text face emoticons for quick and easy copying.

I’d love to know your thoughts. It can be found through here: https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/textcraft/id1546719359

To celebrate the launch, ten lucky commenters will receive a copy of the app for free.

After spending 2 years building, iterating &amp; improving, we finally created Spaces. Create beautiful notes, add infinite tags &amp; connect everything via backlinks, all in real time.

To build the best possible experience we analysed over 25 top writing apps (including Bear, Agenda, Things, Ulysses, iAWriter &amp; more) to create the best design &amp; add most essential features.

Our main vision while building Spaces was to create a clean, distraction-free writing environment. Here's what we built to achieve that:

1. Instant Markdown with automatically hiding syntax (as soon as you move your cursor away).
2. Instant tagging using hashtags with unlimited nesting.
3. Focus Mode &amp; Mark Line that highlights the current line/paragraph.
4. Automatic suggestion of tags based on your past usage.
5. No need of selecting a word to format it, just put your cursor on it &amp; choose the formatting.
6. Live updating word count in the toolbar (in touchbar for MacOS).

Apart from editor, we also paid a lot of attention to design.

1. Placed majority of the options at the bottom for better UX (phones are getting bigger) &amp; so that the user never sees any option while the keyboard is open.
2. Added drag &amp; drop support, keyboard shortcuts &amp; a spotlight like search.
3. Added small, less noticed but essential things missing from other writing apps like multiple selection, proper sectioning between pinned &amp; unpinned notes, add to favorites, sub formatting inside todos, lists and headings etc.

We’ve been beta testing it for around 5 months, did a soft launch recently and we’ve received great response along with lots of feature requests. Can’t wait to hear what you guys think :)

PS - Last time we posted (2 weeks back), the post was removed in a few minutes because of not being active in the community. Have been active since then and took the permission of mods before posting. Anyways, the suggestions we got during that time have all been implemented. So the app is even better now :)

We also have a subbreddit r/SpacesApp.

First off, a massive **thank you** to everyone who downloaded our little game, gave us input, and took the time to say hi. 

Our aim from day one has been to create the perfect Apple-esque Sudoku puzzler, with as many customisation options as possible. We think we did an alright job, but obviously there's always room for improvement. If you'd like to check our game out, [you can download it for free right here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sudoku-master-edition-logic/id1260190370). The only IAP is to get rid of ads.

Making this app has been a dream come true, and it has enabled us to start working on more puzzlers (coming in early 2021 to an i-device near you). We're not a massive studio, we're a husband and wife team trying to make simple apps even better.

**Here's what's already being worked on:**

* Our scoring system is getting a much-needed overhaul. It'll be more coherent across difficulties, mistakes made, and time elapsed - versus just being the simple multiplier it is currently.

* More themes will be added.

* The auto-filling notes button on the game screen can be toggled off / on from the game's settings.

Since posting on here last time, we added iCloud Family Sharing (no clue how we could forget that) - and we forgot to drop a few codes last time, so we wanted to make up for that today. The codes remove ads for good - have fun:

1007,kz43n1,WordSearch Solver - Scan Words To Find Answers (50 Promo Codes),"Hey everyone!

I've been learning Vision (which allows the camera to scan characters) in my free time and I decided to make an app to prove that I could finally understand and use Vision - I'm really proud of what I made and to celebrate I'm giving away 50 codes for an IAP (as the app itself is free).

WordSearch Solver allows you to scan any nearby word searches to display hints and exact locations for any words you cannot find. The app is beautiful and simple to interact with at the same time. I wanted it to be heavily iOS-centric and use many of the design elements present throughout iOS. The app is an iOS exclusive.

I've released version 1.0 for free as I'd love some feedback on how I could improve the user interface and other elements - maybe even add more features?

I'm all ears for any feedback, whether critical or positive.

1018,kz5544,"I've become frustrated with Spotify's mobile app, so I created my own. Let me know what you think about it!","Hey, fellow music lovers

If you built a huge library of music on Spotify, I'm sure you noticed how clunky and non-intuitive the interface is when it comes to browsing music saved in your account. It's clear that Spotify focuses on music discovery (and podcasts) while users who just want to enjoy songs they already know are left with really poor, bare-bones functionality. After using **iTunes** for many, many years it really felt to me like Spotify just doesn't give a heck about **music hoarders** like me 🤓

So I decided to try and build my own music app which would solve many of the headaches I've had with the official app and after 2 years of development I think it is now ready to be considered a serious alternative to it.

It's called **Plum Music Player**. It offers fresh take on music management and innovative ways to manipulate the playback queue. Some of the **unique features** include:

* **Spotify** and local music from **iTunes** in one app
* Instantly access your **favourites** from one screen
* Create **folders** for albums, artists and playlists
* **Last.fm** integration
* Intuitive **gestures** for easy one-handed operation
* Find any song from home screen with **Spotlight** and control the queue with **Widget**
* Set **home tab,** customize layouts, colors, gestures etc.

**Plum** is free to download and offers **3-day trial** which allows you to check out all of its features. **There are no ads nor subscriptions**, if you like the app you can unlock the premium features once and enjoy them forever!

[Download it for free from App Store here](https://apps.apple.com/app/plum-music-player/id1441625664)

I've recently released my new Mac app - [Meet Cam](https://meet.cam), it overlays useful widgets on your camera feed during a video meeting. The app works like a virtual camera with Zoom or Goole Meet and many others. This way you can better control meeting time, express emotions without derailing the conversation, or add some winter mood.

Here’s a highlight of some of Meet Cam's widgets you can use to boost your productivity:

* Meeting Timer - shows how much time left in the meeting
* Countdown - a countdown timer to timebox parts of a call
* Headline - one line of text at the bottom of your video 

and a few more just to bring a smile:

* Snow - in case you are missing the real one,
* Reindeers - well, yeap animated reindeers right in your camera :)

Next in line are emoji and gifs.

It's gotten some really positive feedback from early adopters - as one of the early users said ""it's like a lifejacket in a flood of Zoom meetings"" So I thought to share this here too. Let me know if you guys have any other questions. I'll be happy to answer them.",apple,submission

1700,ku9iol,"We made a Note taking app which is basically a cross between Bear, Apple Notes &amp; Ulysses, and it’s really beautiful &amp; easy to use. Awarded best design &amp; top app of 2020 on Airport!","Hi r/Apple,

We built a lot of apps before, but none of them were good enough. After spending 2 years building, iterating &amp; improving, we finally created Spaces.

To build the best possible experience we analysed over 25 top writing apps (including Bear, Agenda, Things, Ulysses, iAWriter &amp; more) to create the best design &amp; add most essential features.

Our main vision while building Spaces was to create a clean, distraction-free writing environment. Here's what we built to achieve that:

1. Instant Markdown with automatically hiding syntax (as soon as you move your cursor away).
2. Instant tagging using hashtags with unlimited nesting.
3. Focus Mode &amp; Mark Line that highlights the current line/paragraph.
4. Automatic suggestion of tags based on your past usage.
5. No need of selecting a word to format it, just put your cursor on it &amp; choose the formatting.
6. Live updating word count in the toolbar (in touchbar for MacOS).

Apart from editor, we also paid a lot of attention to design.

1. Placed majority of the options at the bottom for better UX (phones are getting bigger) &amp; so that the user never sees any option while the keyboard is open.
2. Added drag &amp; drop support, keyboard shortcuts &amp; a spotlight like search.
3. Added small, less noticed but essential things missing from other writing apps like multiple selection, proper sectioning between pinned &amp; unpinned notes, add to favorites, sub formatting inside todos, lists and headings etc.

We’ve been beta testing it for around 5 months, did a soft launch recently and we’ve received great response along with lots of feature requests. Can’t wait to hear what you guys think :)

Link: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spaces/id1509611686

PS - The last time we posted, the post was soon unapproved because of not being active in the community. Have been active since, and took permission of the mods before posting. Also, the few suggestions we got in the post that time, everything has been implemented, so the app is even better now :)

You can also join us on r/SpacesApp.

1719,kud2eh,New update for my scientific &amp; engineering calculator app. Giving away 10 promo codes to 10 random commenters.,"I’ve just shipped an update to TechniCalc, which is available on iPhone (with companion Apple Watch app), iPad, and macOS.

On iPhone and iPad, you'll now be able to customise the app icon with 3 new designs based off the existing logo - including a solar system icon and a pac-man icon.

This update makes life even easier on your Mac. The new settings panel gives you the option to show TechniCalc in your menu bar and show it with a keyboard shortcut (cmd + ctrl + /). You can also have the app run on startup so the shortcut is always available.

Using degrees, radians, and gradians is even easier. This update brings a new deg and grad function that convert radians to degrees and radians, respectively. Use them on their own, or combine them with functions - like deg arcsin 0.5 - to do the conversion.

And now when you've got a lot of brackets, a focus ring will highlight the start and end of the bracket pair you're editing.

And as always, this update brings more performance and stability updates too - especially around launch times in the app (which were already excellent).

**To celebrate, I’m giving away 10 codes to 10 random commenters. Codes will be given out tomorrow morning (around 9am GMT).**

TechniCalc is a smart calculator for a smart phone. The modern interface that makes a clean break from traditional pocket calculators. Equations are entered in a natural way, adhering to every detail of hand-written maths.

The advanced maths engine also makes this the only calculator you’ll ever need. You’ll find your garden variety logs, sins, and cosines — but for when you need it, the engine has full support for imaginary numbers, vectors, matrices, sums and products, and differentiation and integration.

For those who missed it, it’s a standalone watch app for runners that allows you to display the weekly progress from your running workouts directly on your Apple Watch faces using complications. 

Since then, I have been hard at work and not long ago, I released version 1.5 that cumulatively contains a lot of the great feedback that I received on this sub:

• Made clearer what « Quality Pace » was with in app explications

• Added the option to display the quality pace in percentage instead of in minutes

• Added a new complication for quality percentage

• Added the option to start the week on Sunday instead of Monday

• Added an optional alert feature, where RunFit can send you a notification if your quality percentage for the week gets to high. It will suggest you to run slower from now one, because running fast all the times can increase your chances of injury. 

I wasn’t able to implement a trial feature yet, but I’ve lowered the price to 1.99 USD to make it even more accessible. It’s a one time purchase with no ads, no in-app purchases and absolutely no data collected.

I'm part of the development team of [Hidden](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hidden-secret-images/id1455724330) app. It's an iPhone app that allows users to share sensitive photos privately, while showing a public photo to everyone else.

So, user takes a photo, which will be their private photo. And then pics a public photo, from our existing list, like a cute pet animal, which will represent their public photo.

They share the public photo with everyone, but only those that have the Hidden app can see the private photo.

For a technical explanation -- that private photo is embedded inside the public photo, it is a technique called [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography)

The Hidden app is free, registration is not required and we don't collect personal information. The app is geared towards teenagers and college students to exchange photos privately by hiding them in a public photo. (In theory, it can be used by Journalists for example, who are in war zones, and are taking sensitive photos, and want to hide those private photos in a public photo that is shared).

It is just a 3 step process:

* Take private photo

* Select public photo from existing list provided in app.

* Send both pictures, one embedded in other to friends

To view the private photo inside the app, just click on public photo, and it will flip over.

Would love to hear your opinion on how to improve the app based on the info. Thank you.",apple,submission

1766,kujk91,I created an app to build good habits and get rid of bad ones. Giving away 10 promocodes to random commenters.,"Hey guys! I am a college student and as many others I often suffer from procrastination. A while back I read a book about the importance of building small habits each day. It talks a lot about consistency and staying on track with your goals. Our whole life is build around tiny habits that we don't notice - thus by changing them - we can change who we are. So, I decided to start improving myself but could not find a perfect app that fitted my needs to track my daily habits... so I built one myself. 

With the app you are able to create habits, track them, and build a streak by completing habits daily. If you miss a day you lose your streak, actually motivating you to do your habits and become better. 

I created the app to be beautiful, minimalistic, and not overloaded with unnecessary features that distract you from the actual goal of building habits; and its a onetime small purchase unlocking all features unlike many other habit trackers which force you into expensive subscriptions (a combination which I could not find in any other app). I will be giving away promocodes to lucky commenters, so I am welcoming a discussion on building habits, general self-improvement, suggestions for the app or anything else that comes to mind :)

After spending 2 years building, iterating &amp; improving, we finally created Spaces. Create beautiful notes, add infinite tags &amp; connect everything via backlinks, all in real time.

To build the best possible experience we analysed over 25 top writing apps (including Bear, Agenda, Things, Ulysses, iAWriter &amp; more) to create the best design &amp; add most essential features.

Our main vision while building Spaces was to create a clean, distraction-free writing environment. Here's what we built to achieve that:

1. Instant Markdown with automatically hiding syntax (as soon as you move your cursor away).

2. Instant tagging using hashtags with unlimited nesting.

3. Focus Mode &amp; Mark Line that highlights the current line/paragraph.

4. Automatic suggestion of tags based on your past usage.

5. No need of selecting a word to format it, just put your cursor on it &amp; choose the formatting.

6. Live updating word count in the toolbar (in touchbar for MacOS).

Apart from editor, we also paid a lot of attention to design.

1. Placed majority of the options at the bottom for better UX (phones are getting bigger) &amp; so that the user never sees any option while the keyboard is open.

2. Added drag &amp; drop support, keyboard shortcuts &amp; a spotlight like search.

3. Added small, less noticed but essential things missing from other writing apps like multiple selection, proper sectioning between pinned &amp; unpinned notes, add to favorites, sub formatting inside todos, lists and headings etc.

We’ve been beta testing it for around 5 months, did a soft launch recently and we’ve received great response along with lots of feature requests. Can’t wait to hear what you guys think :)

It also features GameCenter support in form of achievements!

I’ve now got a MAJOR app in the works, and took a break from it to make my first ever publicly released app, WatchThissCube!

WatchThisCube is a puzzle timer app for the Apple Watch. Used for tracking your times to solve puzzles, such as Rubiks Cubes!

The timer is not meant to replace a traditional puzzle timer, such as a stackmat timer, or even a more feature rich puzzle timer app on iPhone. Rather the app is more for on the go usage! If you’re away from your phone, at a friends house and he hands you his cube off the shelf, or maybe you just didn’t want to lug anything else with you, you always have a timer on hand! 

For those of you who don’t participate in the speed solving scene, a transitional timer involves setting your hands on it to “ready” the timer. As soon as your hands lift, the timer stops, you solve the puzzle, then place your hands back on the timer to stop the time. 

The watch app works using this logic by pressing and holding on the screen to start the timer and tapping on completion! The app also saves your times from your session!

My favorite feature is **haptic inspection times!** When speed solving, traditionally you are provided 15 seconds to inspect the puzzle before solving. With WatchThisCube, with inspection time enabled, lifting your finger from the timer starts the 15 second inspection timer. However, when you have 7 seconds left, your wrist gives you a tap! 3 seconds left? Another tap! And finally a tap once 15 seconds has elapsed and the timer begins! Allowing you to keep your eyes on your puzzle and have a hands free inspection!

I’m super stoked for this app! It is simple but effective! I’ve had great enjoyment out of using it myself! And I hope you all do as well! It has been quite the ride so far!

Hi /r/apple, best wishes for 2021!

Years ago, I used to work as an iOS developer for a digital agency. Each Friday, I was asked to submit my hours for that week. I estimated these hours by examining emails, reviewing commits, and finding attended meetings. Like many, I experienced it as a tedious task. Yet, it was of great importance for invoicing and budgeting purposes.

I started looking for apps to help me. Most time tracking apps required me to toggle timers when switching between tasks. I often forgot to do this, making the resulting timesheets inaccurate. Other solutions followed an automatic approach by tracking the apps I used, documents I wrote, and the websites I visited. Not knowing exactly what happened with that data, I felt those apps could potentially harm my privacy.

Working on my thesis and conducting quantitative research, I realized that data sampling could be a great alternative for tracking time. Daily is the resulting implementation of that approach. It works by asking what the user is doing and provides a better way to track time without the hassle of toggling timers. It also protects the privacy of the user by not collecting data other than what the user has explicitly provided.

Fast-forwarding to 2021, thousands of employees, freelancers, founders, and other professionals working in various industries are tracking their time using Daily. They use its timesheets to submit hours, create invoices, or simply increase their productivity.

I hope it can be useful for you too, especially now as you are likely working from home and might need some help protecting your work/life balance.

Stay safe, Niels.",apple,submission

[App Store Link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/liftin/id1445041669)


This past year has been terrible in so many ways, including many gyms that has struggled financially as well as previously active gym-goers has fallen out of shape (myself included).

The situation is still worse than ever in many parts of the world, but I have hopes that we sometime this year can go back to a ”more normal” way of living again.

As a small encouragement I have decided to let all new users of Liftin’ this month get a full year free trial and use it for free all through 2021. Tracking your workouts can make it easier and more fun, and I hope that some of you might rediscover the joy of lifting using the tool I have built.

Remember to follow your local restrictions and work out at home or outdoors if your area is not safe. Have patience and you will hopefully be able to return to the gym later this year!

##What’s Liftin’?

Liftin’ is an iPhone and Apple Watch app for tracking weightlifting and bodyweight exercises. I never loved any of the gym apps in the App Store (I tried them all) so I set out to build my own.

My goal was to build a tool that was really simple and easy to use but had advanced features like automatic progression and support for training max relative weights. I also wanted it to look and feel as if it was designed by Apple.

Please try it out and let me know what you think! I love feedback and I’m constantly looking for ways to improve the app!

If you live in London and get Ubers/Bolts/Free Nows/Black Taxis/(other ride hailing apps I may support if you want it) regularly I made an app that might be helpful for you. It lets you search across multiple on demand taxi / ride hailing apps at once to check pricing, ETA and car type of various products. When you find the option you want the order button sends you through to the relevant app with your route pre populated (unless you order a Bolt, they don't support that). If you don't have the app installed it will take you to the app store for that provider.

It highlights the quickest option by pickup time as well as the cheapest of all the taxis returned for quick use. If you need something more specific there's filters for that (5 seats, disabled access etc).

We've found that our users save an average of £7.50 / trip and you can keep track of the amount you've saved by using RideHub in the savings section of the app.

It pretty much only works for London at the moment. It will work in other UK cities but without the same breadth of choice of provider. Plans for 2021 are to expand the providers across the UK and later Europe to bring delicious choice for ride hailing consumers!

**Why did you bother making this?**

After the culmination of my office Christmas party in 2019 I was drunk, tired and alone. I wanted to be home in my bed as quickly as possible. I then spent the next ten minutes flicking between multiple different ride hailing apps that either had outrageous surge pricing, ETAs of about 25 minutes or just plain no drivers about. This whole process annoyed me. I ended up spending £45 on an Uber for a 12 minute journey. So I made RideHub over that Christmas holiday.

**It doesn't have feature X that I would like**

No problem! I pretty much made this app for myself. If you want to see a particular feature or another ride app supported (will be adding some electric only ride hailing providers in the future) then just ask, we're always looking for feedback.",apple,submission

2998,klk5lw,"We’ve just updated our game Kurit, a minimalistic UI and mechanic board puzzle game my Brother and I made last year - we'd love to hear more from you!","We've updated our game to include the following:

* Leaderboard ranking for each levels
* New “**Peek**” action that allows you to view the slot tiles under the move tiles. Useful when you’re looking for where that slot tile is!
* Added rank achievement banners when completing a level!
* Also squashed some bugs!

Since our players have been begging us for ages for an Android version, not only did we update our game, we also published just last week an Android version of the game too!

&amp;#x200B;

**What’s Kurit?**  
Kurit is a 2D puzzle-board game. Hand-crafted with a calm UI. Each level requires a different strategy to complete — another level is another game. Give it a quick look!

&amp;#x200B;

**Mechanics are fairly simple:**  
Move the colored tiles (“Move tile”) to their respective slot tile that has the same direction arrows. Directions are depicted by the three-lines on the tile.

*That easy right?*

Don’t underestimate it, but if you’re into squishing brain power for a single puzzle level, Kurit is for you!

And we have more for our hardcore puzzle-solvers too on the difficult stage! We’ve introduced some obstacle tiles, directional obstacle tiles where only the same move direction can move through, and more…

&amp;#x200B;

My brother coded the game and I designed the UI and UX for it and this is just our first game.

So if you have any suggestions, feedback, or criticism, we would love to hear back from you as we’re trying to improve it!

Download it on [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kurit/id1460425729).

We also just launched on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/kurit), give it a like if you love the game!

3136,kl39i0,I’ve released version 1.5 of RunFit for Apple Watch with lots of improvements suggested by r/Apple !,"Hello! A few weeks ago, I posted about my first app, [RunFit for Apple Watch](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1530993082). 

It’s a standalone watch app for runners that allows you to display the weekly progress from your running workouts directly on your Apple Watch faces with complications. 

Since then, I have been hard at work and yesterday I released version 1.5 that cumulatively contains a lot of the great feedback that I received on this sub:

• Made clearer what « Quality Pace » was with in app explications

• Added the option to display the quality pace in percentage instead of in minutes

• Added a new complication for quality percentage

• Added the option to start the week on Sunday instead of Monday

• Added an optional alert feature, where, RunFit can send you a notification if your quality percentage for the week gets to high. It will suggest you to run slower from now one, because running fast all the times can increase your chances of injury. 

I wasn’t able to implement a trial feature yet, but I’ve lowered the price to 1.99 USD to make it even more accessible. It’s a one time purchase with no ads, no in-app purchases and absolutely no data collected. 

Hope you like it, as always feel free to leave questions, comments and suggestions!",apple,submission

3140,kl3fal,"Tasks my indie app is now finally available on the Mac too! Featured on 9to5Mac, MacStories and MacRumor! 🚀","Hey Folks, 

[Tasks](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/tasks-to-do-lists-reminders/id1502903102) launched earlier this year in June and you’ll were fabulous, thank you for that! Just last month, Tasks launched for Mac, would love for you to try it out on any of the platforms. It is now my full time gig! 

Yet another Task manager? 
Yep, kinda, but, Tasks allows you to make kanban boards where tasks can have more statuses like “todo”, “in progress”, “verify” and “done”. It feels like a native app from Apple. You can customize so many parts of your projects which you didn’t even know you required until you try it out once! You can create tags, assign tasks unique types and everything is stored completely within your iCloud, never leaves it and I can never access it. I don’t track anything and won’t in the future. I respect each and every user’s privacy as I would like mine to be respected. 

Tasks is free for all to try and I generously have provided 2 free projects where you can try ALL the functionality without hitting the paywall except for when attempting to share a project with someone else. Hope that suffices!🌟

There is an ongoing holidays discount in the app for a couple more, it’s free with in app purchases (subscription and lifetime options which best suit you). 

What’s next? 
Siri Shortcuts, Watch app, TV app and a whole lot more. 

Read about it on [9to5Mac here!](https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/25/tasks-app-gets-update-with-new-features-macos-version-more/)

Thank you. Ask me any questions, glad to answer each and every single one of them!

3166,kl5cxc,"I created Metrics, an iOS app to track anything you want, with monthly views and charts, widgets, and automatic reading from health","I am an indie developer passionate about self-tracking. So I built an app, Metrics, that I use to track all kinds of stuff from health and fitness data (most of it gathered automatically from Health data) or other personal data that I enter daily (e.g: time spend working, reading).

The app offers iCloud sync, widgets, and some stats. I plan to extend it by adding a goals section. If you want to gather some stats about your 2020 steps, distance walked, heart rate, or other metrics that can read from the Health app, this is a great tool. Also, I find it very useful for daily tracking of stuff that is not automatically trackable and to build good habits, like reading, quit smoking, personal hygiene, and more.

The app is free to download and it offers by default 21 metrics, many of them synced with health. You will need a Pro subscription ($1.99 / month or $19.99/year) for custom metrics, widgets, and charts. 

I always take privacy very seriously so  I don't collect any of your data. The app doesn't store data in any external servers, I just track some stuff related to app interaction (screens visible, buttons tapped), without user tracking or identification. The data is kept local (Core Data) and it also can be synced on multiple devices via iCloud. I have no access to any health or other personal data and I don't use any external libraries that might track users.

It will be really useful to hear your opinion, so if you want to take a look and leave me some honest feedback let me know in the comments and I will offer you a promo code for a 1-month subscription (available for the first 25 people)

The app can be downloaded from here: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metrics-build-great-habits/id1492356525](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metrics-build-great-habits/id1492356525)

3832,kgu5lo,Many people from r/apple requested it so I added Cloud Movement to my free Weather Radar Widget app so you know if the storm is coming towards you,"Hi r/apple

After iOS 14 came out, I have made a widget app that shows Weather Radar on your home screen: [Just launched a Free Widget App for iOS 14 that shows Live Weather Radar with Dark Sky color theme. Rain and snow, supports dark mode and updates every 10 minutes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/j03wu2/just_launched_a_free_widget_app_for_ios_14_that/)   


It was greatly received on this subreddit, but one of the most requested features was the ability to see the animation of the radar, to know if the storm is moving away or towards you. Unfortunately, the widget system has some limitations, for example it’s not possible to display moving content, such as an animated weather radar.  
 

To solve this issue, Weather Radar Widget applies machine learning on series of radar images to estimate the motion of precipitation areas. This movement is then visualised on the widget as arrows showing the way, giving users clear idea of the direction that the bad weather is coming from. 

The app is free, has no ads and does not track you in any way:

3835,kgubzo,[Promo Sunday] ProStyle Camera by NeuralCam - shoot &amp; edit like a professional photographer,"Hey everyone,

Photo editing apps are cool and have become very popular lately, but each of them requires some amount of photo editing skill to use. Be it a basic editing app or a professional desktop application like Lightroom, it requires quite some amount of time and effort to get nice photos and even so, results are still quite different from the professional look that most users strive for. 

We just launched [ProStyle Camera](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1543452919) \- a new app and platform that aims to make photo editing significantly easier and more accessible by mixing the power of AI and the creative power of professional photographers. 

ProStyle is a photo editor and camera app that edits photos &amp; videos with one tap in the style of a professional photographer. At the same time, it’s also a platform for creating these AI powered professional editing styles and then selling them through the built-in Style Store. 

At the heart of ProStyle is a proprietary AI engine that can learn a photo editing style from a dataset of edited photos and can apply the learned style to photos taken by the user on their phone. This allows users to edit photos with one tap similar to what pro photographers achieve using professional photo editing software and years of experience, also containing the fine details of their unique editing style. 

You can download the ProStyle Camera app for free from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1543452919), try it out and let us know what you think.

We're also giving away 10 yearly promo codes for the ProStyle Membership, which unlocks the video mode, along with additional AI features and advanced UI.",apple,submission

*Wall Tones has an In-App Purchase – for $0.99 USD.  Using the app is COMPLETELY free to try out, you can get to know the app and see if you like it.  The In-App Purchase does not come up until you try to export a color or gradient as a wallpaper.  This is a ONE-TIME purchase!  After purchase is completed – you can export AS MANY wallpapers as you would like.*

This update improves a bunch of features of the app: 

- Gradients can now contain more than 2 colors
- Gradients and colors can now be previewed, full screen
- Context menus for colors and gradients now have more options
- Gradients, when exported, are much smoother - no longer appearing stepped

I hope you love it!

4498,kc5uox,[FREE] The Storyteller - Artificial Intelligence Powered Voice Actors,"This is my latest application using Artificial Intelligence. I always needed voice actors for YouTube videos, but there were no real options other than to pay someone on Fiverr to do so. Until now!

In short, AI matches the pitch of the previous word to the current word via spectrogram. This ensures a smooth flow between words making it sound like a real human.

Available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-storyteller-ai-tts/id1543117308) FREE

[Watch my demo video!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKHLmK-Mhec&amp;feature=youtu.be)

Create invigorating stories using different voice actors. Artificial Intelligence will make your story flow smooth, seemless, and coherent. Save your stories to listen to them anytime.

Read back anything (TTS)

If you don't want to read that article, or need a narration for any reason; use the read back function. You may select from a series of voice actors and download the audio in an mp3 format.

Included FREE are 6 amazing voice actors that will create amazing stories by talking to each other. One even speaks Spanish! Download more amazing voice actors for that perfect speech.

One free page of TTS a day (3000 characters). Purchase more for the lowest prices online!

This app is perfect for YouTube VoiceOvers, Business Commercials, or anyone who would like a Voice Actor for any reason. Create amazing conversations between voice actors and save them to listen anytime.

Someone asked me in another thread, how does this compare to pricing of professional voice actors? Well, its almost a quarter of a percent to what they charge! To hire a professional voice actor to read Tolstoy's *War and Peace,* you would be looking at a cool $20,000. With The Storyteller, you can get away for less than $60! My prices closely reflect what I pay to run the Artificial Intelligence services. It doesn't get better than that!

4517,kc82e9,Apple Playlists Plus - A better way to discover new playlists,"Hi guys,

I made this website/app: https://apple-playlists-plus.gawlk.workers.dev/

Which helps you discover new playlists based on an artist, a song, a genre or even words. Because let's face it, finding new playlists on Apple Music can be quite frustrating.

The current database is still quite small with around 30k playlists but I have a raspberry that is constantly fetching data from Apple servers and pushing it to a database. Every request made on the website is cached for 24 hours so don't worry if you don't see the numbers going up immediately.

For those interested the project is made with Vue JS 3, Tailwind CSS, Cloudflare Workers for hosting and caching, Fauna for the database and I use [Apple's Music API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi) to pump their data.

This project isn't exactly free for me, it costs me around 60 euros per month (Fauna being the biggest part of that), so if you want to help me (which a would really appreciate) here's a link: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/gawlk

Anyway, hope you'll like it 🎵

My new app, EmojiScope generates a new emoji-based prediction made up of three emojis each day, just for you. EmojiScopes are totally open to interpretation and it's up to you to find their meaning or the story behind them. 

**App Store link**: https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/emojiscope/id1532843344#?platform=iphone

**App site:** https://emojiscope.app

**Why the hell did you make this?**

* EmojiScope began as my COVID-19 lockdown project after I began learning Swift and SwiftUI in May with the aim to build and launch my first app by the end of 2020.

* I liked the idea of making something new that could be fun to share with people and I didn't want to take things too seriously. My friends who've tested the app for me have been given some hilarious, or eerily accurate results.

I've got a a laundry list of features and updates planned and a lot of work ahead of me and I'll continue to update EmojiScope in future. 

I'd love to hear how accurate (or inaccurate) your EmojiScopes are, and all of the stories that go along with them.

Please try it out, I'm really interested in any feedback you've got, too!

Cheers,
Dave.",apple,submission

4533,kcad2u,"Rethinking language learning for all Apple Devices with Widgets, Complications, iCloud - Independent universal Japanese app - Kanji Time","TL;DR: Kanji Time is a new app I made to learn Japanese vocabulary and kanji on all Apple platforms from watchOS to iOS and macOS. 100% native Apple technologies. ⌚️ 📱 💻 

App Store: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1527539097](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1527539097)

Here is a quick demo highlighting the UI and key features: [https://twitter.com/adartem/status/1337860696630026240](https://twitter.com/adartem/status/1337860696630026240)

Now with iOS 14 ,I decided to extend Kanji Time to all platforms not only Apple Watch.

I think immersion is crucial for language learning. Therefore supporting all devices is very important. Especially with features like widgets you are always exposed to new vocabulary.

&amp;#x200B;

* Widgets and Complications: repeat words and kanji at glance of your watch or home screen
* Fully automatic sync across devices through iCloud
* Smart notifications taking your progress into consideration
* Fast UI and 2000+ kanji animations, SwiftUI, 0 third party dependencies (iOS with watch app only 25MB)
* No registration, no email, no tracking, no ads

It is made accessible for all kinds of difficulty levels has more than 10000 words to fit different learning styles. For beginner levels its completely free.

Update to existing users: Don’t worry all your existing progress will automatically port to the new version and sync with all devices. -Notifications are now reworked entirely

If Japanese is not your cup of *sencha*, I plan to provide other languages with this framework.

Any feedback ist highly welcome!",apple,submission
